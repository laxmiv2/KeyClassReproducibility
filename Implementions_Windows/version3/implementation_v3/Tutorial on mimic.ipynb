    "### 1.1 Electronic Health Records (EHR) \n",
    "\n",
    "The Electronic Health Record __(EHR)__ system is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart. __EHRs__ are almost-real-time, patient-centered records that contain `patient history`, `diagnoses`, `procedures`, `medications`, and more in an easily accessible format. Since the _Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health_ <b>(HITECH)</b> Act was signed into law in 2009, adoption rates of these systems have steadily increased<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>1</b></a></sup>. Adler-Milstein et al.<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>2</b></a></sup>, who analyzed survey data collected by American Hospital Association found that EHR adoption rates were at <code><b>80%</b></code> in __2017__, twice the rate in __2008__. With higher adoption rates comes the rising challenge of _data processing and analysis of unstructured clinical text._ Due to the unstructured nature of clinical notes, providers often employ trained staff and/or third-party vendors to help assign diagnostic codes using coding systems such as the International Classification of Diseases __(ICD)__<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>3</b></a></sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "__However, manual assignment of ICD codes is problematic:__\n",
    "1. It is both time consuming and error-prone, with only <code><b>60-80%</b></code> of the assigned codes reflecting actual patient diagnoses<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>4</b></a></sup>\n",
    "1. A significant portion of code assignment results in misjudged severity of conditions and code omissions<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>5</b></a></sup>\n",
    "1. For healthcare providers, billing and coding errors may not only lead to loss of revenue and claim denials, but also federal penalties for erroneous Medicare and Medicaid claims\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, there is a clear need for reliable automated classification of unstructured clinical notes."

It automatically creates interpretable labeling functions (LFs) by extracting frequent keywords and phrases that are highly indicative of a particular class from the unlabeled text using a pre-trained language model. It then uses these LFs along with Data Programming (DP) to generate probabilistic labels for training data, which are used to train a downstream classifier <sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>13</b></a></sup>."

    "1. To the best of our knowledge, all prior work on ICD code assignment utilized __fully supervised ML techniques__, most of them relying on vast quantities of labeled training data\n",
    "1. In this work, we explore the use of our proposed __weakly supervised model _KeyClass___ to assign top-level `ICD-9` codes to long patient discharge summaries\n",

    "__Text Classification with Sparse Training Labels<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>[9,10]</b></a></sup>:__\n",

    "1. Secondly, while previously proposed state-of-the-art models are committed to specific language model architectures for linguistic knowledge and representation learning, KeyClass offers a high degree of modularity, enabling end users to adapt the neural language model (encoder) and downstream classifiers to specific problems, such as clinical text classification\n",

    "view as being `positive` or `negative`. In order to initiate the classification process, domain experts provide <code><b>KeyClass</b></code> with common sense descriptions of a __positive__ (`good amazing exciting positive`) and __negative review__ (`terrible bad boring negative`). In most cases, these descriptions can be automatically generated from Wikipedia articles or reference manuals and validated by domain experts, further reducing manual effort.

    "\n",
    "Once we have the class descriptions, KeyClass automatically discovers highly suggestive keywords and phrases for each class. KeyClass first obtains frequent n-grams from the training corpus to serve as keywords or key-phrases for its automatically composed labeling functions. In order to transform the keywords into labeling functions of the prescribed form, KeyClass leverage the general linguistic knowledge stored within pre-trained neural language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers __(BERT)__<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>14</b></a></sup>, to map each keyword to the most semantically related category description. To create a labeling function, KeyClass simply assigns a keyword to its closest category as measured by the cosine similarity between their embeddings. In order to ensure equal representation of all classes, KeyClass sub-samples the top-k labeling functions per class, ordering them by cosine similarity. While theoretically data programming benefits from as many labeling functions as possible, the sampling is required due to computational and space constraints."

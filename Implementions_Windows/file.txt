ADDENDUM:

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Radiologic studies also included a chest
CT, which confirmed cavitary lesions in the left lung apex
consistent with infectious process/tuberculosis.  This also
moderate-sized left pleural effusion.

HEAD CT:  Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect, but old infarction consistent with past medical
history.

ABDOMINAL CT:  Abdominal CT showed lesions of
T10 and sacrum most likely secondary to osteoporosis. These can
be followed by repeat imaging as an outpatient.

Service:  MICU and then to [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with a history of emphysema (not on home O2), who presents
with three days of shortness of breath thought by her primary
care doctor to be a COPD flare.  Two days prior to admission,
she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to
admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain
oxygen saturation greater than 90%.  She has also been on
levofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Room.

In the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was
100% on CPAP.  She was not able to be weaned off of this
despite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV x2.

Review of systems is negative for the following:  Fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight,
gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes,
palpitations, orthopnea.  Is positive for the following:
Chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with
exertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally
related, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD.  Last pulmonary function tests in [**2117-11-3**]
demonstrated a FVC of 52% of predicted, a FEV1 of 54% of
predicted, a MMF of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of
67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator
treatment.  The FVC, however, does significantly improve with
bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible
air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive
ventilatory defect.  The patient has never been on home
oxygen prior to this recent episode.  She has never been on
steroid taper or been intubated in the past.
2. Lacunar CVA.  MRI of the head in [**2114-11-4**]
demonstrates "mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2
signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres
as well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to
the right of midline.  The abnormalities, while nonspecific
in etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic
microvascular infarction.  There is no mass, lesion, shift of
the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus.  The major
vascular flow patterns are preserved.  There is moderate
right maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left
maxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal
thickening.  These abnormalities could represent an allergic
or some other type of inflammatory process.  Additionally
noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella
turcica".
3. Angina:  Most recent stress test was in [**2118-1-3**]
going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of
10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence
of ischemic EKG changes or symptoms.  The imaging portion of
the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and
a calculated ejection fraction of 84%.  The patient denies
angina at rest and gets angina with walking a few blocks.
Are alleviated by sublingual nitroglycerin.
4. Hypothyroidism on Synthroid.
5. Depression on Lexapro.
6. Motor vehicle accident with head injury approximately 10
years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 q.d.
2. Prednisone 60 mg, 50 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg.

7. Albuterol nebulizer q.4. prn.
8. Lexapro 10 mg q.d.
9. Protonix 40 mg q.d.
10. Aspirin 81 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Norvasc leads to lightheadedness and headache.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband, Dr. [**Known lastname 1809**] an
eminent Pediatric Neurologist at [**Hospital3 1810**].  The
patient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10
years.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,
heart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%
axillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP
with dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent
distress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx
difficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of
jugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP
machine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy.  Heart exam:  Tachycardic, regular, obscured
by loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory
phase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the
lung fields.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, obese, no masses.  Mild edema of the lower
extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes.  There
is a right hand hematoma.  Strength is assessed as [**5-9**] in the
lower extremities, [**5-9**] in the upper extremities with a normal
mental status and cognition.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets
300.  Chem-7:  127, 3.6, 88, 29, 17, 0.6, 143.  Troponin was
negative.  CKs were negative times three.  Initial blood gas
showed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.

Chest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia,
segmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus
segmental atelectasis.

EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal
axis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed
on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation
despite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer
treatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were
increased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have
labored breathing.

Due to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,
the patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve
oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A
bronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated
marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent
with tracheomalacia.

On [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left
main stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.

On [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel
mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal
cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical
floor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off
on [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2
liters, 92% on room air.

On [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional
Pulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved
and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with
followup within six weeks' time status post placement of
stents in respiratory failure.

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She
did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,
which showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative
troponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,
Imdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient
regimen.

3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and
hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and
normalization of electrolytes.

4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely
secondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was
discontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  She had serial urinalyses, which
were all negative for signs of infection.

5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding
scale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This
worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels
once the steroids were tapered to off.

6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of
20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids
were tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]
was 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary
to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe
pneumonia.

7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had
initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.
from [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]
for an additional seven day course given the fact that she
still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the
left lower lobe.

8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient
medical regimen.

9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per
outpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up
with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she
did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital
course, and did appear clinically to be depressed.

10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor
with subQ Heparin.

11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much
of the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated
with Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution
containing Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.

12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code
throughout her hospital course, and communication was
maintained with the patient and her husband.

13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle
weakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found
to have impaired functional mobility, impaired
musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired
endurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine
to sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair
for approximately one hour.

On motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower
extremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at
the elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was
most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well
as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a
prolonged hospital course.

14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow
evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of
vocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on
room air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly
weak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood
pressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with
transmitted upper airway sounds.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]
for both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levothyroxine 75 mcg p.o. q.d.

13. Trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn.
14. SubQ Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until such
time that the patient is able to get out of bed twice a day.
15. Cepacol lozenges q.2h. prn.
16. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a seven day course to
be completed on [**2118-6-21**].
17. Kaopectate/Benadryl/lidocaine 5 mL p.o. b.i.d. prn, not
to be given around mealtimes for concern of dysphagia induced
by lidocaine.
18. Lorazepam 0.5-2 mg IV q.6h. prn.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is recommended to followup with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1407**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1408**] within two weeks of leaving
of the hospital.  She is also recommended to followup with
the Interventional Pulmonary service for followup status post
stent placement.  She is also recommended to followup with a
neurologist if her muscle weakness does not improve within
one week on physical therapy with concern for steroid-induced
myopathy.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Tracheomalacia status post tracheal and left main stem
bronchial stent placement.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypothyroidism.
4. Restrictive lung defect.
5. Depression.

History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman has a history of COPD. Over the past five

years she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing.
In
[**2118-6-4**] she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure
due
to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she
required
intubation and a eventual bronchoscopy on [**2118-6-9**] revealed marked

narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with
tracheomalacia.
She subsequently underwent placement of two
silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the
trachea. During the admission the patient had complaints of
chest
pain and ruled out for an MI. She was subsequently discharged to

[**Hospital1 **] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy
on
[**2118-8-1**] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral
wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the

peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the
airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were
also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in
her
respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty

with mesh. Tracheal stents d/c [**2119-4-19**] in anticipation of
surgery.
In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent
chest pain that she describes as left sided and occurring at any

time. Currently, she notices it about three times a week, and
states that it seems to resolve after three nitroglycerin.
She currently is dependent on oxygen and wears 1.5-2 liters
around the clock. She has frequent coughing and brings up "dark
sputum".

an acute worsening in dyspnea, and called EMS. EMS found patient
tachypnic at saturating 90% on 5L. Patient was noted to be
tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the ER.
.
According the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms
consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently patient was
without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, PND,
dysuria, diarrhea, confusion and neck pain. Her husband is a
physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning.
.
In the ED, patient was saturating 96% on NRB. CXR did not reveal
any consolidation. Per report EKG was unremarkable. Laboratory
evaluation revealed a leukocytosis if 14 and lactate of 2.2.
Patient received combivent nebs, solumedrol 125 mg IV x1,
aspirin 325 mg po x1. Mg sulfate 2 g IV x1, azithromycin 500 mg
IVx1, levofloxacin 750 mg IVx1, and Cefrtiaxone 1g IVx1. Patient
became tachpnic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but
became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was
removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2
hours. At that time patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87% and
tachypnic to the 40s, so patient was intubated. Post intubation
ABG was 7.3/60/88/31. Propafol was switched to
fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2L of
NS. On transfer, patient VS were 102, 87/33, 100% on 60% 450 x
18 PEEP 5. Patient has peripheral access x2.
.
In the ICU, patient appeared comfortable.

CXR ([**2124-7-21**]) - IMPRESSION: Hiatal hernia, otherwise
unremarkable. Limited exam.

Echo ([**2124-7-24**]) - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR ([**2124-8-5**]) - Kyphotic positioning. Compared with one day
earlier and allowing for technical differences, the right-sided
effusion may be slightly larger. Otherwise, no significant
change is detected. Again seen is retrocardiac opacity
consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
and a small left effusion. As noted, a right effusion is again
seen, possibly slightly larger on the current examination, with
underlying collapse and/or consolidation. Doubt CHF.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with h/o CHF, COPD on 5 L oxygen at baseline,
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent, presents with acute dyspnea
over several days, no s/p intubation for hypercarbic respiratory
failure.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Presents with dyspnea, but no
clear cough or fevers. Per report, patient felt like this with
prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible
pneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with
this. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram
stain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew
parainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on
solumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no
evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics
were stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were
continued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with
normal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy
revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had
difficulty weaning from the vent, and would become
interimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the
50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but
required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening
secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of
note, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in
sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely
represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the
patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped
after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's
family and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative
care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she
would not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued
again and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory
status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical
floor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with
nebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical
exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently
diuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath
with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks
of anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her
breathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was
begun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3
more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4
days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.
.
# Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG
tube. Lavage for approx 600ccs with clearance. GI perfomred EGD
which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach
body, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. H pylori was
negative. Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat
EGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved
given abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable
with no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the
patient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO
pantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.
.
# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness
at the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and
they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy
and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was
checked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and
physical rehab.
.
# CAD: History of LAD and RCA stenosis on Cath, but no stents.
Continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI
bleeding (see above)
.
# Nutrition: Unable to pass NG without direct visualization due
to hiatal hernia. IR guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on
[**7-26**] for TFs and po medications. NG tube was pulled when patient
was extubated on [**2124-8-3**]. Speech and swallow were consulted
following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved
to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.

# Goals of care: PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions
regarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed
along with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's
extubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be
DNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family
felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that
she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status
were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on
comfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the
floor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with
intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.
After several days with stable or improved overall clinical
status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the timem
of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate,
okay to intubate.

   RADIOLOGY
==================

CT scan C spine [**2162-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fracture of the C6 as described involving the right pedicle
(extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior
widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7
facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely
rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

2.  Lucency in the right posterior C1 ring may represent a
chronic injury.
Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 pedicle on the left.

3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments with
compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is
further
described above.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2162-3-3**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right
hemithorax, likely pseudotumors.
3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear
etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further
evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non- emergent basis.
4. Bilateral renal cysts.
5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra.
Recommend emergent repositioning.

CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([**2162-3-3**])
1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue
swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe.
Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal
hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit.
3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate
with CT C- spine performed concurrently.

HEAD CT ([**2162-3-3**])
1. No acute intracranial hemprrhage.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma.
3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from
facial bone CT scan.
4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to
dedeicated CT C-spine for further detail.
5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old
infarction.

CHEST [**2162-3-10**]
The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most
likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are
demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three
leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild
pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid
within the major fissure.

CT HEAD [**2162-3-11**]
1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the
occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend followp
imaging.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size.
3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated
maxillofacial CT.

RIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([**2162-3-11**])
Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.
Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the
scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic
considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis,
intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the
subscapularis tendon.
Increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor
fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest
CT

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-3-13**])
1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending
proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to
involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the
right cephalic vein.
2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual
son[**Name (NI) 493**] features somewhat suspicious for malignancy.
Followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy
may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.

[**2162-3-14**]
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated
appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The
visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm
hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the
liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but
statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are
bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal
in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic
body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the
stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops
appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral
contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without
evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air.
There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle,
tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel
loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged,
measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a
moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free
fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is
DISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also
are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large
acetabular osteophytes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.
2. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with
associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No
associated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate
clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to s.q.
injections.
3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could
represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded.
If this is of concern, then MRI is again recommended for further
evaluation.
4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too
small to accurately characterize.
5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.
6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.

A wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1831**] [**Name (STitle) 1832**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1833**] at 11:30 p.m. on [**2162-3-14**].

[**2162-3-16**]
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video
fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration
of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the
speech pathologist.

ORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, AP tongue
movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar
elevation. There is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal
elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. There is
moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. There is
residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate
impairment of bolus propulsion. There was aspiration of both
thin and puree barium.

IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids and puree. For additional
information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's
report from the same day.

[**2162-3-18**] CT Head w/out:
FINDINGS: There is a small amount of blood layering in the
occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not
as dense given evolution. No new hemorrhage is identified. The
ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to
involutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities
are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia
in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is
unchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
Skin staples are noted along the superior- posterior neck
secondary to recent spinal surgery.

IMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small
intraventricular hemorrhage.

No discharge labs as patient CMO.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after his fall from a height
of approximatly 10 feet.  CT scans of his chest, abdomen and
pelvis were negative for pathology.  CT scan of his C-spine
showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at C6-7.  He
was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture.

C-spine fracture: Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] two surgical
procedures to stabilized his c-spine.  [**2162-3-4**]: anterior
cervical decompression/fusion at C6-7.  [**2162-3-5**]: Cervical
laminectomy C6-C7 & T1 with Posterior cervical arthrodesis
C4-T1.  He tolerated the procedures well.  He was extubated
without complication.

After his surgical procedures, Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] was transfered
to the medicine service at [**Hospital1 18**] for his medical care. While on

aspirating and failed his speech and swallow evaluation. Patient
and family were not interested in an NG tube or PEG for
nutrition. Patient also developed a venous clot of the right
upper extremity and the decision was made to not proceed with
medical treatment. Goals of care were changed to comfort
measures only. A foley was placed after patient had difficulty
with urinary retention and straight cathing. A palliative care

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Craniotomy


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 622**] [**Known lastname 1836**] is a 62-year-old woman, with longstanding
history of rheumatoid arthritis, probable Sweet's syndrome, and
multiple joint complications requiring orthopedic interventions.
She was found to hve a right cavernous sinus and nasopharyngeal
mass.  She underwent a biopsy of hte nasopharyngeal mass by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1837**] and the pathology, including flow
cytometry,
was reactive for T-cell lymphoid hyperplasia only.

She has a longstanding history of rheumatoid arthritis that
involved small and large joints in her body.  Her disease is
currently controlled by abatacept, hydroxychloroquine, and
methotrexate.  She also has a remote history of erythematous
nodules at her shins, dermatosis (probable Sweet's disease),
severe holocranial headache with an intensity of [**9-28**], and
dysphagia.  But her symptoms resolved with treatment for
autoimmune disease.  Please refer additional past medical
history, past surgical history, facial history, and social
history to the initial note on [**2171-11-4**].

She cam to the BTC for discussion about management of her right
cavernous sinus mass that extends into the middle cranial fossa.


She had a recent head CT at the [**Hospital1 756**] and Woman's Hospital on
[**2171-11-29**], when she went for a consultation there.
She is neurologically stable without headache, nausea, vomiting,
seizure, imbalance, or fall. She has no new systemic complaints.

Her neurological problem started [**9-/2171**] when she experienced
frontal pressure-like sensations.  There was no temporal
pattern;
but they may occur more often in the evening.
She had fullness in her ear and she also had a cold coinciding
to
the onset of her headache.  By late [**Month (only) 359**] and early [**2171-10-21**], she also developed a sharp pain intermittently in the
right
temple region.
She did not have nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, imbalance, or
fall.  A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI, performed at [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2171-10-30**], showed a bright mass
involving the cavernous sinus.

Past Medical History:
She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis unspecified
dermatosis, right knee replacement, left hip replacement, and
fusion of subtalar joint, and resection of a benign left parotid
gland tumor.


Social History:
She is married.  She had smoked for approximately a year and a
half when she was younger, but is not currently smoking.  She
has approximately one glass of wine per week.  She is retired
but was employed as a teacher.


Family History:
Cancer, diabetes, hearing loss, and heart disease.


Physical Exam:
AF VSS
HEENT normal
no LNN
Neck supple.
RRR
CTA
NTTP
warm peripherals

Neurological Examination:  Her Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  She is neurologically intact.


Pertinent Results:
MRI [**3-5**]
Right middle cranial fossa mass likely represents a meningioma
and is stable since MRI of [**2172-2-11**]. The previously seen
midline nasopharyngeal mass has decreased in size since MRI of
[**2168-2-11**]. Direct visual inspection would be helpful for
further assessment of the nasopharyngeal mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively for meningioma resection of [**3-5**].
She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the
operating room. She was trasnported to the ICU post-operatively
for management. She had no complications and was transferred to
the floor and observed for 24 hours. Prelim path is consistent
with meningioma.
She has dissolvable sutures, and will need to come to
neurosurgery clinic in [**6-28**] days for wound check only.
She will need to be scheduled for brain tumor clinic. She will
complete Decadron taper on [**3-10**] and then restart her maintenance
dose of prednisone. She will also be taking Keppra for seizure
prophlyaxis.
Her neurologic examination was intact with no deficits at
discharge. She was tolerating regular diet. She should continue
to take over the counter laxatives as needed.

History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with CAD, CHF, HTN, recent PE ([**10-17**]), who presents from
rehab with hypoxia and SOB despite Abx treatment for PNA x 3
days. The patient was in rehab after being discharged from here
for PE. She was scheduled to be discharged on [**12-6**]; on the day
prior to discharge she deveoped fever, hypoxia, and SOB. CXR
showed b/t lower lobe infiltrates. She was started on levoflox
and ceftriaxone on [**12-5**]. When she became hypoxic on NC they
brought her in to the ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she was febrile to 102.7, P 109 BP 135/56 R 34
O2 90% on 3L. She was started on vanc and zosyn for broader
coverage, tylenol, and 2L NS.
.
The patient reports having sweats and cough before admission.
She complains of SOB and some upper back pain. She denies chest
pain, URI sx, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, or dysuria. Of note she
had had a rash and was given prednisone for 7 days, ending
[**12-3**]. The rash was speculated to be due to coumadin, but she
was able to be continued on coumadin.

[**2112-12-8**] PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The heart size and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits. No definite
pleural effusions are seen. There is diffusely increased
interstitial opacity disease, predominantly in the lower lung
zones. No pneumothorax seen. The osseous structures are stable.
A hiatal hernia is noted. Tiny left pleural effusion is noted.

IMPRESSION: Diffusely increased interstitial opacities. This
appearance is consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion
superimposed upon chronic interstitial changes.
.
[**2112-12-9**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-19**] and
[**12-8**]:

Severe progressive interstitial abnormality accompanied by
pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion is most likely
edema, but severe interstitial pneumonia either infectious or
drug related could simulate these findings. Chronic hiatus
hernia unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with CAD, CHF, HTN, recent PE ([**10-17**]), who presents from
rehab with PNA and hypoxia.
.
Chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates. Patient was started
on Zosyn and vancomycin for pneumonia. Her fluid status was
closely monitored given her underlying CHF. On admission her
daughters were in disagreement over her code status and her
original long standing DNR/DNI status was changed to allow for
intubation if needed. However, when the patient's respiratory
status continued to decline to the point of need for intubation,
the patient refused intubation. Her family was notified and
agreed that their mother's wishes should be fulfilled.  She was
started on IV morphine then converted to morphine drip on HD #3
for comfort and all other medications were discontinued. Her
family was at her bedside and their Rabbi was called. She died
on [**2112-12-10**] at 2:20 pm. An autopsy was offered, but the family
declined.

left sided brain lesion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2-25**] Left Craniotomy for mass resection


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1852**] is a 62-year-old left-handed man who is here for a
follow up of his left sphenoid meningioma.  I last saw him on
[**2149-11-17**] and his head CT showed growth of the left sphenoid
meningioma.  He is seizure free.  Today, he is here with his
wife
and daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] does not have headache, nausea, vomiting,
urinary incontinence, or fall.

His neurological problem began on [**2142-6-22**] when he became
confused and disoriented in a hotel bathroom.  At that time, he
was visiting his daughter for a wedding.  His wife found him
slumped over in the bath tube.  According to her, his eyes
looked
funny.  He could not stand up.  His verbal output did not make
sense.  He was brought to [**Doctor First Name 1853**] Hospital in Placentia,
CA.  He woke up 7 to 8 hours later in the emergency room.  He
felt very tired after the event.  He was hospitalized from
[**2142-6-22**] to [**2142-6-25**].  He had a cardiac pacemaker placement due
to irregular heart rate and bradycardia.  He also had a head MRI
that showed a less than 1 cm diameter sphenoid meningioma.


Past Medical History:
Cardiac arrhythmia as noted above, has a
pacemaker in place, prostate cancer with prostatectomy, and
hypertension.


Social History:
Lives with his wife.  Retired, works parttime
driving a school bus.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Temperature is 97.8 F.  His blood pressure
is 150/92.  Pulse is 80.  Respiration is 16.  His skin
has full turgor.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythms.  His lungs
are clear.  His abdomen is soft with good bowel sounds.  His
extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

Neurological Examination:  His Karnofsky Performance Score is
100.  He is awake, alert, and oriented times 3.  There His
language is fluent with good comprehension.  His recent recall
is
intact.  Cranial Nerve Examination:  His pupils are equal and
reactive to light, 4 mm to 2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular
movements are full.  There is no nystagmus.  Visual fields are
full to confrontation.  Funduscopic examination reveals sharp
disks margins bilaterally.  His face is symmetric.  Facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  His hearing is intact
bilaterally.  His tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the
midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.
Motor Examination:  He does not have a drift.  His muscle
strengths are [**5-16**] at all muscle groups.  His muscle tone is
normal.  His reflexes are 0 in upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.  His ankle jerks are absent.  His toes are
down going.  Sensory examination is intact to touch and
proprioception.  Coordination examination does not reveal
dysmetria.  His gait is normal.  He can do tandem.  He does not
have a Romberg.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON DISCHARGE:
non focal
incision c/d/i, dissolvable sutures

Pertinent Results:
[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Likely meningioma along the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the left sphenoid
bone,
measuring 18 mm in diameter, unchanged since the most recent
study of [**11/2149**], with reactive bony changes, as above.
2. Bifrontal cortical atrophy, which has progressed slightly
over the series of studies since the earliest studies of [**2142**].

[**2-25**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
Expected post-operative changes with the left frontal craniotomy
including
subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling, moderate
pneumocephalus overlying predominantly the bilateral frontal
lobes, and foci of hemorrhage in the surgical bed. No evidence
of residual tumor on this non contrast CT.

[**2-26**] CXR: FINDINGS: The lung volumes are rather low. There is
moderate cardiomegaly without evidence of overt pulmonary edema.
No areas of atelectasis or pneumonia. Right pectoral pacemaker
in situ, with correct lead placement.


[**2-28**] Head CT /c contrast: IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal
craniotomy changes with improvement of pneumocephalus and stable
3 mm left to right midline shift; focus of hemorrhage
with/without residual tumor in the resection bed is similar in
appearance to prior exam but now with more surrounding vasogenic
edema. Stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Followup to
assess for residual tumor/ interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively on [**2-25**] for left sided craniotomy
for mass resection. he tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the Trauma ICU post-operatively still intubated.
Shortly thereafter he was deemed fit for extubation which was
done without difficulty. At post-op check he was neurologically
intact.
On [**2-26**] he was neurologically intact and cleared for transfer to
the stepdown unit. This did not happen due to bed shortage. A CT
with contrast was ordered for post op evaluation.
On [**2-27**] he was again stable and cleared for transfer to the
floor. Decadron taper was initiated. He was seen by PT and
cleared for discharge home.
On [**2-28**] the patient was being prepped for discharge but was
noted to have intermittent heart rate in the 130-170's. His
other vitals were stable. Electrophysiology was consulted and

Pathology Report from [**2118-8-10**]:
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Brain, left frontal (A):
    1.  Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous
malformation
    of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced
fibrinoid
    necrosis.
    2.  Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior
hemorrhages.
2.  Left frontal radionecrosis and residual AVM (B):
    1.  Vascular malformation consistent with arteriovenous
malformation
    of cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with radiation induced
fibrinoid
    necrosis.
    2.  Focal hemosiderin deposition suggesting prior
hemorrhages.
Clinical:  Radionecrosis.

CT Head post-op [**8-10**]:
FINDINGS: There is a left-sided frontal craniotomy with surgical
resection of the enhancing "mass" noted in previous studies.
There is extensive confluent hypodensity in the left
frontoparietal region, that likely represents post-radiation
vasogenic edema with resultant 8.5-mm shift of normally-midline
structures, not significantly changed from the previous MR.
There is a tiny focus of hyperdensity in the postoperative field
which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage. There is
expost-operative pneumocephalus and subcutaneous air noted.

IMPRESSION: Status post left craniotomy and resection of AVM and
possible
"mass"-like radiation necrosis, with small hyperdense focus in
the operative bed, likely representing very small hemorrhage.
Extensive vasogenic edema persists.

Post-operatively she was admitted to the ICU for observation s/p
resection. Her Post-op head CT was negative for bleeding. She
remained intubated immediately post-op. She was weaned and
extubated on [**8-11**] and did very well neurologically. The patient
was transferred out of the ICU later that day. She was
ambulating without difficulty, her pain was well-controlled, and
she was taking in food with no nausea/vomiting. Her
post-operative MRI was done on [**8-12**] and showed expected
post-operative changes. She was discharged on [**2118-8-12**].

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line insertion (right internal jugular vein)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] is an 84 yo man with moderate aortic stenosis (outside
hospital echo in [**2124**] with [**Location (un) 109**] 1 cm2, gradient 28 mmHg, moderate
mitral regurgitation, mild aortic insufficiency), chronic left
ventricular systolic heart failure with EF 25-30%, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, CAD s/p CABG in [**2099**] with
SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and SVG-RPDA-RPL, with a re-do CABG in
[**9-/2117**] with LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA. He also
has severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass
surgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with
shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart
failure.

He states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last
evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed
moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest
associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was
fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at
6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP
109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart
failure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70.
He given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis),
Nitropaste [**1-3**]", and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance
transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low
BP).

On further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise
tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis.
But he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last
night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat,
carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to
walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated
with dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms
occur about every day to every other day and have been stable
over the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify
the amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and
feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.

ROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several
months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and
currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.

Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG twice (vide infra).
2. Hypertension.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Peripheral arterial disease with occluded left common iliac
artery, S/P right iliac artery stenting and femoral-to-femoral
bypass, further angioplasty to the right profunda.
5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic LV systolic heart
failure, reported LVEF 25-30%.
6. Moderate-severe aortic stenosis.
7. Osteoarthritis.

CAD: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension

Cardiac History: CABG in [**2099**] (SVG-LAD-Diagonal, SVG-OM, and
SVG-RPDA-RPL), with a re-do CABG in [**9-/2117**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-diagonal, and SVG-RCA)

Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2120**] anatomy as follows:
Patent SVG to OM1, patent SVG to PDA which filled the distal PDA
as well as the R-PL via a jump segment. Stump occlusion of a
graft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that
could be documented of a graft to the left. Other SVG's were not
able to be selectively engaged. Supravalvular aortography
demonstrated no other patent grafts. Patent LIMA to mid-LAD,
which also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft
that was interposed between the LAD and the diagonal.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is extensive family history of early coronary disease
(father died of MI at 44, one brother died in 40's, one in 50's,

ECG [**2125-2-9**]  9:36:38 PM
Rhythm is most likely sinus rhythm with frequent ventricular
premature beats with occasional ventricular bigeminal pattern.
There are also frequent atrial premature beats. Intraventricular
conduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave
changes most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-4-9**] ventricular premature
beats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

CXR [**2125-2-9**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG.
The heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the
previous study.  Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward
the lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe
pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also
new, most likely part of the heart failure.   Left and right
retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.

ECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl
walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF
= 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images
unavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now
depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 84 yo man with CAD s/p CABG twice with daily
angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive
heart failure.

# CAD: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup
and treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on
admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a
stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart
failure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10
mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this
well, however at approximately 8 pm on [**2125-2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] was
transferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest
pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being
evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and
developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were
started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became
responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to
be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the
50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that
he had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening
without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his
arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the
setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis).  On transfer to
the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and
amiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval
worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar atelectasis.  At this time his cardiac enzymes became
very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK
to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic
echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the
inferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe
aortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was
aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in
his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray.  Levophed was
discontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off
pressors with MAP's 60 - 70.  On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred
back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal
sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was
continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and
improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no
shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was
maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in
the ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s
upon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to
relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creat 1.7. A
cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a
3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending
re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term
plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and
discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist
regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.

On [**2-16**], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to
60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given
1L NS with no response in BP. The patient was mentating but
became short of breath with IVF. He had worsening EKG changes.
He was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood
pressure. He was brought to the catherization laboratory for
potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At
that point, he suffered a PEA arrest and could not be
resuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.

# Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with
initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He
was treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [**2-16**] to
po Lasix 80 mg po twice daily.

# Rhythm: Patient was in NSR on admission. On HD #2, he had
chest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above.
Telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the
CCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered
over the subsequent weeks.

# Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined
(creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7
- 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).

# Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley
placement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on
[**2-16**] with gradual resolution of hematuria.

# Diabetes: Due to acute renal failre, metformin was
discontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding
scale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime.

# Hematoma. The patient developed a small hematoma at the site
of his right internal jugular venous access after catheter
removal. This was treated with local compression.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo f w/ h/o CRI, htn, h/o nephrotic syndrome, w/ diarrhea,
c.diff pos at rehab, failure to respond to flagyl, w/ elev wbc,
and negative ct. A brief-problem based hospital course is
outlined below.

1) presumed c.diff infxn- Admitted and started on p.o. vancomyin
and IV metronidazole, w/ addition of levofloxacin for broad
spectrum coverage given recent abd surgery. Cholestyramine was
initially given for toxin binding. WBC was 30 on admission and
trended down with ABX; however, C.diff toxin neg x5, so
diagnosis remains presumptive.  C. diff B toxin was sent and was
negative as well. She completed a 3 week course of PO vanco and
IV flagyl antibiotics, which was completed on [**5-14**]. She
subsequently remained afebrile without further diarrhea, and was
able to tolerate PO's.

2) [**Name (NI) 1866**] Pt began having episodes of BRBPR on [**4-25**] with
resultant slow HCT drop. GI and surgery were consulted. Pt had
no abdominal pain, but given recent surgery and low albumin, we
were concerned that the bleed may be evidence of ischemic bowel
or dehiscence. Pt was also having intermittent episodes of
tachycardia, raising the possibility that she was having embolic
phenomena with acute ischemia. However, she had no abdominal
pain to suggest this. Colonoscopy was done on [**4-30**], showing
severe c dif vs. ischemic bowel. Surgery found that pt was not
surgical candidate and believed her bleeding and mucosal damage
was [**2-29**] c dif and would continue to improve. Biopsy results
showed no evidence of c.dif, but given pt's tenuous status, po
vanco and iv flagyl were continued while awaiting toxin B. It is
quite possible that the mucosal changes seen on colonoscopy were
the result of C dif infxn, which had been treated w/ABX and
resolved, leaving the mucosae to heal. As well, GI felt there
may be a superimposed ischemic insult. No further work-up was
performed since she had good clinical resolution of her colitis,
following completion of cdiff treatment.

2) acute renal failure w/ CRI-  Renal team was consulted on
admisison.  Baseline cr is approx 2.0.  On admission this was
significantly elevated to 4.1.  FENA was c/w prerenal etiology
and patient had R IJ placed in ED, started on NS for volume
resusciation.  This was undertaken slowly given that pt had an
albumin of 1.4 and pleural effusions were noted on CT.  Fluids
were changed to 1/2NS w/ bicarb on HD2. Cr trended down each day
and the patient has maintained oxygenation.   Alb/cr ratio not
c/w nephrotic range proteinuria- thus it was felt that the low
alb was likely multifactorial. Pt initially required boluses of
500cc NS to maintain Uop ~20-30cc/hr. With hydration and
improvement in her diarrhea, her Cr steadily decreased and
returned to baseline of 1.6. She was seen by renal who felt that
her increase in creatinine may have been secondary to
ATN/hypotension and recommended avoiding aggressive
overdiuresis. She did subsequently require aggressive diuresis
given her rapid afib/chf with lasix and niseritide drips.
However her creatinine remained at baseline of 1.7-2.0 with
diuresis. She did develop a transient metabolic alkalosis, which
was felt likely from volume contraction alkalosis. Therefore her
lasix was weaned to 40mg daily and her bicarb trended back down
to 30. Her creatinine was stable at 1.6 at the time of
discharge.

3) [**Name (NI) 1867**] Pt was noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic
on admisison.   Unclear why it was low when patient presented.
Most likely [**2-29**] extreme inflammatory/SIRS response (given elev
lactate on admission). Her PLT count dropped to 95 and DIC
workup and HIT Ab were sent, both negative. Her PLT count rose
as her clinical condition improved and remained in normal range
for the duration of her hosital course.

4) HTN - Pt's baseline SBP is in the 180s-200s range. On
admission, BP was low [**2-29**] 3rd spacing and early sepsis. Her BP
responded to fluids and she remained relatively normotensive.
She was continued on metoprolol for HR/BP control and
isordil/hydral was added for afterload reduction.

5) CHF - Evidence of CHF on initial CXR. Her EF was found to be
40% (previously normal), bringing up concern for ischemic event
precipitating her failure. In support of this she was noted to
have wall motion abnormalities on ECHO with inferoseptal/basal
hypokinesis. Diagnostic catheritization was not performed due to
her renal insufficiency and decompensated CHF. She was managed
medically, and on [**5-10**] the CHF service was consulted for
management. She was initiated on aggressive diuresis with IV
lasix for goal -1.5L per day. She was transferred to the CCU
briefly on [**5-12**] for more tailored therapy and diuresis for her
CHF (lasix boluses and nesiritide) with good effect (negative
approximately 500 cc overnight). She was transferred back to the
floor on lasix boluses.

Due to continued evidence of volume overload she was given 160mg
IV [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] + started on lasix drip at 10mg/hr. Then started
nesiritide [**Month/Year (2) 1868**] (1mcg/kg) followed by gtt at 0.01mcg/kg/min.
Diuresed well to this and maintained BP well, however after
increasing natrecor to 0.015, went back into rapid afib. Stopped
natrecor on [**5-17**]. Stopped lasix gtt on [**5-18**] given persistent
good diuresis. Now tapered down to 40mg daily lasix/day +
afterload reduction w/ Isordil/Hydral on [**5-22**]. At the time of
discharge, she was felt to be euvolemic with goal of matching
ins and outs daily. We will continue her on this regimen upon
discharge.

7.  Atrial fibrillation: Initially converted from RAF by medical
cardioversion performed with procainamide gtt in the CCU at
13mg/kg/hr x10min load followed by 2mg/hr for 2h trial. Became
hypotensive to 60's systolic, but subsequently recovered. Then
again went into RAF on [**5-17**] early am. Initially HR controlled w/
IV lopressor/IV dilt. Then [**Hospital 1869**] medical cardioversion w/
procainamide. Became hypotensive to 70's systolic after about 10
minutes on procainamide [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was stopped and her blood
pressures normalized. She then converted 10 min later to NSR.
She has been in NSR the remainder of her hospital course. She is
not on coumadin due to risk for bleed. In addition, amiodorone
was discussed as a medical option for continued rythm control.
However, given the side effect profile, the family and patient
were more comfortable with holding off on adding amiodorone at
this time. They understand that there is a higher risk of
conversion back to atrial fibrillation and increased risk for
stroke without amiodorone.  We will continue rate control with
metoprolol as mentioned at 25mg TID, and may titrate up as
needed to maintain HR <80.

8. CAD- wall motion abnormalities on ECHO w/ inferoseptal/basal
HK. currently chest pain free. continuing with medical
management. On statin/b-blocker. No plan for cath at this time
given her renal insuff/co-morbiditites. Also holding off on
aspirin currently given her bleed risk. This will be
re-addressed as an outpatient through her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

9. Anemia- Initially had episode of GI bleed with blood loss
anemia requiring 3 units of packed red blood cells. Hematocrit
subsequently normalized. However, she subsequently was noted to
have a low, but stable, hematocrit at 28-29. Repeat stool
guaiacs were all negative and she had no further evidence of
bleed or hemolysis. Iron stores were also found to be within
normal limits, with low TIBC and high ferritin suggesting anemia
of chronic disease. This was felt likely secondary to chronic
renal insufficiency. She was started on EPO 2,000 Units q m,w,fr
on [**5-22**]. The goal transfusion criteria would be 30 given her
history of CAD, however, we have held off on further transfusion
at this time given her known CHF with recent severe volume
overload. We have set transfusion goal at hct>28, and transfused
with 1 unit packed red blood cells and 20mg IV lasix for hct
<28.

10. tachypnea- Resolved. Her transient tachypnea was felt likely
secondary to volume overload. There was no evidence of
infiltrate by CXR. Her ABG at the time on [**5-15**] showed
7.29/43/99. Her respiratory status subsequently improved that
same day on [**5-15**] following IV lasix and atrovent nebulizers.
Avoided albuterol nebulizers over concern for tachycardia.

11. F/E/N- Started on TPN for nutritional supplementation. She
also had a swallow study which showed ability to tolerated
regular solids and thin liquids. She has been taking in PO's as
tolerated, but has continued to require TPN to reach nutritional
goals. This will be continued upon discharge at rehab.

1.  HIV positive for 21 years.
2.  History of intravenous drug abuse.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Right above the knee amputation after being hit by a
truck in the past.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Epivir.
2.  Ziagen.
3.  Bactrim Double Strength.
4.  Lasix.
5.  Methadone.
6.  Lopressor.
7.  Prilosec.
8.  Risperdal.
9.  Aldactone.
10. Folate.
11. Multivitamins.
12. Thiamine.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.3, heart rate 116, blood pressure 140/palpable,
respiratory rate 16, pulse oximetry of 100%.  General:  He
was alert and oriented times three with a GCS of 15.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular motions were intact.
The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  The oropharynx was clear.  The TMs were
clear.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no
subcutaneous air noted.  Cardiac:  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  There was a 1.5
cm left upper quadrant wound, otherwise diffusely tender.
Back:  No step-off.  No deformities.  Nontender.
Extremities:  A right above the knee amputation with
prosthesis.  Left leg with chronic venostasis changes.
Rectal:  Good tone.  Contaminated by external blood.
Neurological:  No focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION:  Chemistries generally normal
with creatinine of 1.2.  Blood gas 7.39/49/341/31/4, lactate
2.5, amylase 107, fibrinogen 171.  PT 15.8, PTT 36.1, INR
1.7.  His white blood count was 5.1, hematocrit 34.4.  Urine
toxicology was not performed.

A chest x-ray was within normal limits, status post left
subclavian line placement which was in place.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
for wound exploration directly from the Trauma Room.  The
patient was taken to the Operating Room, as mentioned above,
for an exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions,
and control of rectus and omental bleeding.  The estimated
blood loss was approximately 1,000 cc.  Please see the
operative note dictated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2199-2-8**] for
complete report.

The patient was then transferred to the SICU where his
coagulopathy was corrected.  He received 4 units of packed
red cells, 4 units of FFP, and 1 cryoprecipitate.

While on the unit, he was extubated on [**2199-2-10**], SICU
day number three and he was noted to have progressive
thrombocytopenia.  His home p.o. medications were restarted
as well.

On [**2199-2-11**], hospital day number four, the patient
was transferred to the floor.  His diet was advanced and he
was placed on an aggressive bowel regimen to get his bowels
moving postsurgically.  The Pain Service was also consulted
because of the patient's history of narcotic abuse and his
continued complaints of pain.  They recommended increasing
his dose of Klonopin and starting MSIR.

On hospital day number five, the patient was noted to have a
heparin-induced antibody which may be one of the reasons he
was coagulopathic on admission, although his HIV disease and
other drug abuse cannot be ruled out as cause.  His platelet
count remained relatively stable, however, as did his
hematocrit.

By hospital day number six, the patient was doing somewhat
better; however, after being noted to be somewhat sedated,
his Klonopin dose as well as MSIR and methadone were
decreased.  The patient did work with Physical Therapy and
was able to ambulate, hop a bit out of bed.

Additionally, Case Management spoke with the patient's
long-term nurse practitioner, who stated that at baseline he
normally uses a wheelchair and occasionally walks on his
prosthesis.  Additionally, the nurse practitioner stated that
the patient does chronically abuse drugs, both prescriptions
and illicits, and advised not to give the patient any pain
prescriptions upon discharge as he had more than enough at
home.  It was also discussed that the patient would often try
to prolong his hospital courses in the past in an attempt to
get more narcotics.

On the date of discharge, the patient will be set up with VNA
Services for home to change his dressings.  He will also be
instructed to follow-up with his primary care doctor or
Trauma Clinic to have the staples removed from his abdominal
wound.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with services.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Same as on admission.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  As mentioned above, with the Trauma Clinic
and his primary care doctor.

.
ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Pre-pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is
elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. The
left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. There is a large circumferential
pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w some organization. There is left atrial
diastolic collapse. There is right ventricular diastolic
collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology. There is significant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-10-20**],
large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of
tamponade is new.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Post pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity
is markedly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is partial flail of a tricuspid valve leaflet. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**],
the residue pericardial effusion is minimal.
.
Cardiac catherization ([**2203-11-3**]):
1. Large circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade
physiology.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500mls of
blood
stained fluid. Patient left cathlab in stable condition
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe pericardial tamponade.
2. Mild primary pulmonary hypertension.
3. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500ml of
blood
stained fluid.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-4**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and
tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal [intrinsic
function is likely depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.]. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants that do not fully
coapt. A small echodensity is seen on the right atrial side of
the septal leaflet - ?vegetation ?old vs. partial flail of
leaflet segment. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a small (<1cm), circumferential, partially echo filled
pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise.

Compared with the prior study (post-pericardiocentesis, images
reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**], the findings are similar.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened and appear shortened/remnants and fail to fully
coapt. A small echodensity is again seen on the right atrial
side of the septal leaflet which could be either a vegeateion or
a partial leaflet segment. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation
is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is
echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other
cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-4**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly smaller and may be more
echo dense. The left ventricular cavity size is probably
slightly larger (reflecting better filling). The small
echodensity on the tricuspid leaflet has not changed in size.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-8**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-5**],
pericardial effusion now appears slightly smaller.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-11**]):
The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. There is a very
small, partially echo filled pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-8**],
the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old male with HIV/AIDS, previous R-sided endocarditis
and severe TR, presented in cardiac tamponade from
rehabilitation.

CARDIAC TAMPONADE:  On admission, he was transferred to the
cardiac catherization lab, where over one liter of fluid was
drained from his pericardial space.  The fluid was sent for gram
stain, culture, AFB, [**Doctor First Name **], TB PCR as well as viral studies and
cytology.  A pericardial drain was initially left in place, but
given minimal drainage over 24 hours, was pulled prior to his
transfer to the floor.  The etiology of the pericardial effusion
is unknown.  He was followed by Cardiology on the floor and the
initial plan was for a pericardial window, for both tissue and
to prevent reaccumulation of fluid.  The patient refused the
procedure at this time.  He will follow up as an outpatient to
re-evaluate for the procedure.  The effusion was followed by
serial ECHO while the patient was in the hospital.  There was no
evidence of re-accumulation.  He is scheduled for an outpatient
ECHO in several weeks to evaluate the pericardial space for
reaccumlation of effusion.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/FLUTTER: Per multiple EKGs, the patient
appears to have developed new a fib/flutter.  Given his guaiac
positive stools, it is not advisable to start anticoagulation at
this time.  The patient is being rate controlled on a low dose
of beta-blocker, which appears to be effective.  He will be
followed by outpatient Cardiology.

ANEMIA: The patient had a hematocrit drop during this admission.
 His lab studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease,
however, the patient was found to have guaiac positive stools.
GI was consulted and recommeded colonoscopy and EGD.  The
patient was unable to tolerate the prep and thus the colonoscopy
was cancelled.  His EGD demonstrated gastritis and thrush.  He
was started on fluconazole to treat the thrush.  He was also
transfused two units of packed red blood cells with an
appropriate hematocrit response.

HIV/AIDS:  The patient had a CD4 count checked during his last
admission, it was found to be 132 with a viral load >100K.
Given his past noncompliance with HAART therapy and the risk of
developing drug resistant HIV,  HAART was not restarted.  Pt is
willing to restart HARRT, and the plan remains to restart
medications at rehabilitation.  Bactrim was continued for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

OSTEOMYELITIS:  The patient was previously admitted for left
ankle pain.  He was followed previously by both the orthopedic
and ID services.  Both services continued to follow the patient
on this admission.  The patient was continued on 6 weeks of IV
antibiotics (last day of cefazolin [**2203-12-5**]), although the dose
was decreased to 1g q6 because of a low white blood count.

SEVERE TRICUSPID REGURGITATION: Pt with known grade 4 TR and
flail leaflet which he deveoped after acute bacterial
endocarditis roughly 10 years ago.  We restarted his lasix and
spironolactone on this admission.

HCV: HCV viral load checked, and found to be 1.5 million.  No
further therapy initiated.

ANXIETY: Pt with history of anxiety and on Klonapin at home.
His home regimen was continued.

ESOPHAGEAL CANDIDIASIS: Patient was found to have thrush on EGD.
 He was started on a course of fluconazole given his
immunosupressed state.  He is being discharged to complete a two
week course of anti-fungal medication.

Service:  MEDICINE ONCOLOGY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with a history of metastatic melanoma with known metastases
to the liver and lung who status post resection in the 90s
with recurrence in [**2146**] status post treatment with Taxol.

She presented to the Emergency Room on [**2152-10-3**],
with altered mental status, decreased p.o. intake, confusion
and headache over several weeks, and was found to have three
mass lesions in her brain on head CT.

The patient was started on Decadron, as well as Dilantin.  In
the Emergency Room she became hypertensive and was sent to
the SICU.  She was maintained on Nipride GTT.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was weaned off
Nipride and then changed to Labetalol, Hydralazine. The patient
was also noted to have cellulitis on her left knee and was
initially maintained on Vancomycin and later changed to Keflex.

The patient was also evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it
was decided that the patient would received a total of seven
treatments of whole brain radiation therapy in conjunction
with Decadron, as well as Dilantin.

During her Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient had
increased alertness and was more oriented, although she does
have a history of baseline dementia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic melanoma status post
resection in [**2138**] with recurrence in [**2146**] status post
treatment with Taxol.  History of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation with anticoagulation in the past.  Status post
PCM for sinoatrial dysfunction.  History of coronary artery
disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2143**].  MIBI in
[**2152-6-23**] showed an ejection fraction of 50%.  History of
hypercholesterolemia.  History of hypertension,
osteoarthritis, cellulitis.  Status post skin graft.  Peptic
ulcer disease.  History of bladder cancer.  Chronic renal
insufficiency.

ALLERGIES:  AMOXICILLIN, OXACILLIN AND PERCOCET, REACTIONS
UNKNOWN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Imdur 30 mg, Warfarin, Lasix 20
q.d., Calcium Carbonate 1500 q.d., Vitamin D 4000 q.d.,
Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Protonix 40 q.d., Dietrol 2 mg b.i.d.,
Labetalol 300 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a home health aide.  Husband
died three months ago.  She walks but recently was unable to
do so.  She otherwise has a very close family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  On maternal side there is a history of
diabetes, as well as hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 96.5??????, blood
pressure 161/47, pulse 74, respirations 14, oxygen saturation
98% on 2 L, 92% on room air.  General:  She was elderly,
lying in bed.  She was sometimes agitated and not following
commands.  She was nonverbal.  HEENT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Dry mucous membranes.  There
was poor dentition.  Neck:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.
Heart:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  There was an early
systolic ejection murmur, 3 out of 6.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Good bowel sounds.  Extremities:  There were
bilateral skin eschars.  The left knee had excoriation and
was erythematous.  Neurological:  The patient was obtunded
and not following commands.  She had a limited neurologic
exam.  Cranial nerves II, III and IV intact.  She was moving
both hands with appropriate strength.  No lifting of left arm
off bed.  Right lower extremity with decreased strength,
apparently chronic secondary to polio.  On the left lower
extremity, she moved toes and feet.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission her white count was 6.4,
hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 269, neutrophils 73, 22
lymphs, 3 monos; INR 1.1, PT 12.7, PTT 27.8; sodium 138,
potassium 4.3, chloride 106, bicarb 22, BUN 36, creatinine
1.8, baseline 1.4-1.5; platelet count 151; calcium 10.6,
magnesium 1.9, phos 3.1, CK 116, MB 5, troponin 0.04; Albumin
4.2; TSH 2.9; urinalysis with occasional bacteria, trace
ketones, 30 protein.

Electrocardiogram was paced, lateral T-wave inversion,
inferior T-wave inversion which new consistent with [**2152-6-23**].

Head CT showed three moderately large-sized mass lesions in
the right posterior frontal, right anterior frontal lobe and
left parietal lesion with significant edema.  There was a
small amount of peripheral density, question of hemorrhage or
calcification.

Chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, atelectasis, but no overt
failure.

Knee films showed no fracture and no dislocation and
degenerative changes with small right knee effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Altered mental status:  This was felt
to be secondary to metastatic disease to the brain.  The
patient was evaluated by Radiation/Oncology, and it was
decided that the patient would receive a total of seven
treatments of whole-brain radiation therapy.

Additionally she was maintained on Decadron, as well as
Dilantin.  The patient had no seizure activity while in the
hospital.  She tolerated her Decadron well and tolerated her
whole-brain radiation therapy without any complications.

The patient was discharged on a Decadron taper.  Her Dilantin
dose was increased to a total of 300 three times a day, given
that her Dilantin level [**Company 2240**].i.d. was only 8.  The
patient will need her Dilantin level followed as an
outpatient at her next appointment.

2.  Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressures while in the
Emergency Room were noted to be 200/100; however, once she
was transferred to the floor, she maintained very good
control on a combination of Clonidine, Hydrochlorothiazide
and Minoxidil, Hydralazine, as well as Labetalol 400 b.i.d.
The patient's blood pressures were maintained in the 140s to
160s systolic, and it was decided that this was an
appropriate range given that the patient needed to have
adequate perfusion in the face of increased
intracranial pressure.

3.  Cellulitis:  The patient was initially maintained on
Vancomycin, and this was later changed to Keflex.  The
patient did not develop any rash or other complications
Keflex.  Her cellulitis was improved by the time of
discharge.

4.  Renal insufficiency:  Her creatinine remained at baseline
between 1.4-1.5.

5.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was maintained on
enteric coated Aspirin, as well as Labetalol.  The patient
ruled out for myocardial infarction, and her
electrocardiogram remained stable without any EKG changes.

6.  FEN:  The patient was maintained on a soft diet, as well
as thin liquids.  She tolerated this without event.
Additionally her electrolytes were followed daily and were
repleted as needed.  Her I&Os were monitored closely.

7.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  The patient is paced.
She was rate controlled.  She was held off all
anticoagulation given her metastatic disease to the brain.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to her home because
her family wanted the patient to do so.  The patient has [**12-27**]
full-time nurses that will be following her once she is
discharged to home.  Her mental status improved greatly while
the patient was in the hospital.  By the time of discharge,
the patient was conversive and much more alert and oriented.

Her neurologic exam was significant for intact cranial nerves
and the ability to move all extremities spontaneously.  She
did have limited movement in her arms, given that she has a
history of bursitis.  Otherwise, the patient's exam
neurologically was much improved.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.  She was stable on room air.
She could not ambulate without assistance and does need help
with all bed transfers.  She was tolerating a p.o. diet
without problems.  [**Name (NI) **] mental status had improved
considerably in that she was conversant, could move her
extremities spontaneously, and cranial nerves were intact.
Her strength was notable for weakness throughout but was
symmetric.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the liver, lung
and brain.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  Bursitis.
7.  Cellulitis.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
9.  Coronary artery disease.
10. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  As stated above, the patient will be
discharged to home with [**Hospital 2241**] nursing care.  Home Hospice
has been discussed with the family, and they would like to
avail this possibility as the need arises.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2251**] is a 70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy [**1-1**]
aortic outflow obstruction, AICD s/p VT, CAD, COPD (on home O2)
who presented with decreased UO and SOB, now transferred from
medicine service to CCU for hypotension. Pt is currently
somnolent and unable to provide a detailed history, so details
are obtained from OMR and Atrius records.  Pt saw NP in complex
care clinic on [**7-10**], at that time felt well overall, c/o dry
cough but denied SOB, peripheral edema. At that time her weight
was recorded at 185 lbs (dry weight is estimated at 184 lbs). On
[**7-17**] she called the CCC office c/o minimal urine output ("only
drops") and cough productive of yellow sputum.  She reported
compliance with her home diuretic regimen, but [**Name8 (MD) **] NP note she
had not filled her aldactone rx.
.
On DOA, she called EMS due to increasing SOB.  When EMS arrived
her SBP was 80.  She received 250cc NS and was brought to ED.
In ED she had SBP 90s so received another 500cc NS bolus. CXR
showed no e/o infiltrate but she was treated empirically for CAP
with 1g ceftriaxone given her recent productive cough. Labs were
significant for Na 121 and Cr 5.4 (baseline 3.5-4.0). She was
admitted to medicine service.  On the floor, her BP was
initially 98/65 but then decreased to SBP 70s.  She was
transferred to CCU for pressor support.
.
On transfer, vitals were T 95.7, HR 60 (v-paced), BP 110/56, RR
18, O2sat 100% on 2LNC.  She was drowsy, but denied current SOB,
chest pain, palpitations, LE swelling.  She endorsed orthopnea
(c/w baseline) cough productive of yellow sputum, nausea, RUQ
discomfort, and anuria. Denied recent fevers/chills,
diarrhea/constipation, melena/hematochezia, BRBPR.
.
Of note she was admitted 1 month ago (from [**Date range (1) 2266**]) for CHF
exacerbation and hypervolemia. She was started on a lasix drip
with metolazone but was ultimately started on ultrafiltration
with a tunneled HD line which she tolerated well. She has not
required outpatient HD since discharge.

aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2194-7-18**]: There is a left-sided pacemaker/ICD with right
atrial and right ventricular leads, as before. Severe
cardiomegaly is not significantly changed. Pulmonary venous
congestion is seen without definite interstitial pulmonary
edema. No focal consolidations are seen. There are no pleural
effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. There is minimal right

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission
70yoF with h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 35%), AICD p/w SOB and
poor urine output for several days found to have hyponatremia,
now transferred from medicine to CCU due to hypotension.
.
Active Issues:
.
#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient was
hypervolemic on exam with elevated JVP and increased abdominal
distension at presentation.  Given the patient had been
refractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during
her last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on
admission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic
therapy. She experienced significant muscle cramping and
hypotension while on CVVHD requiring dopamine. CVVHD was
discontinued on HD#2 and she was diuresed with IV lasix and
metolazone. Pressures improved and she was weaned off of
dopamine.  It was noted that urine and blood pressure improved
when the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with
asynchronous ventricular pacing.  Therefore the patients
pacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased native
rhythm and the mode was changed to AAIR.  Despite this change
urine output remained poor and she was therefore started on a
lasix drip ultimately requiring milrinone to augment diuresis.
On HD#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis
catheter, and on HD#7 she continued HD using the tunneled line
(see below). Lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient
will be HD dependent.
.
#Hypotension:  Patient was hypotensive on admission in the
setting of volume overload.  Her hypotension was believed to be
due to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated
cardiomyopathy. She was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this
was weaned by HD#2.  In addition, she experienced episodes of
hypotension with CVVH with diuresis and antihypertensive
medications, so her antihypertensive medications were held. On
discharge, her BP was stable.  She was asked to continue to hold
her carvedilol and to follow up with her PCP about restarting as
tolerated.
.
# Hyponatremia: Pts sodium was 119 on admission and likely cause
of her AMS, thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia with poor
renal perfusion given e/o volume overload on exam and low urine
Na. Her fluid intake was restricted to 1.5L daily, and she
started CVVH as above with improvement in her hyponatremia as
well as her mental status.  At the time of discharge her sodium
was 135.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient was noted to have a
creat of 5.4, baseline 3.5-4.0, and oliguria x 2-3 days on
admission. As stated above she had previously required
ultrafiltration during hospitalizations for heart failure
exacerbation.  Renal was consulted and felt that the patient
would require chronic HD.  Given her hypotension she was
initally started on CVVH with dopamine gtt for pressure support.
 However as above she did not tolerate CVVH and it was
discontinued.  She was diuresed with lasix gtt and milrinone as
above until she had her tunneled line placed on HD#6.  She
tolerated HD well, with stable BP and no muscle cramping.
Outpatient dialysis was arranged with [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] Dialysis
Center for mondays, wednesdays and fridays.
.
# Afib: Pt has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin at
home.  On admission her coumadin was held in preparation for
placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter. As stated above her
pacemaker settings were changed and she was in sinus rhythm for
most of her CCU course with heart rates in the 50-70s.  Her mode
was changed to AAIR to allow for intrinsice AV conduction and
minimize ventricular pacing in an abnormal heart. Her coumadin
was restarted at her home dose on HD#7.  Her INR at the time of
discharge was 1.4.

# Stable issues:
.
# COPD: Patient's recent cough and SOB with h/o COPD was
initially c/f COPD exacerbation, and she was initially started
on prednisone and levofloxacin. However there was no wheezing on
exam therefore prednisone and antibiotics were discontinued. She
was continued on her home albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer
treatments, and maintained O2 sats >90% on 2L NC (her baseline
O2 requirement).
.
# CAD: Stable, no c/o chest pain during hospitalization.  She
was continued on her home ASA and pravastatin.
.
# HTN: Carvedilol was discontinued due to frequent episodes of
hypotension (with SBP 70s-80s).  She can resume as an outpatient
if BP tolerates.
.
# Gout: Patient was continued on her home allopurinol and did
not have any pain concerning for a gout flare.
.
# Transitional issues:
- Patient maintained full code status throughout
hospitalization.
- She will continue outpatient hemodialysis at [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **]
Dialysis Center
- She has follow-up scheduled with her PCP and her cardiologist.
 She will be contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding a follow-up appointment with

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the
hospital.

You were admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath and
not making urine. Your heart was not pumping well which caused
you to have extra fluid.  We gave you medication to help you to
urinate out this fluid however your kidneys were not working
properly and you needed dialysis to do the job of your kidneys.
You got a special IV to be used for dialysis. You will need to
continue going to dialysis three times a week. Your blood
pressure was also so low so we did not give you your home blood
pressure medications while you were in the hospital.

You should continue to go to dialysis three times a week.  You
were also started on a medication called nephrocaps that you
will need to continue.

You should stop taking your carvedilol, metolazone,
spironolactone and lasix unless your doctor instructs you to
restart these medications.

Continue your coumadin and amiodarone for your abnormal heart
rhythm (atrial fibrillation).  Continue your aspirin and
pravastatin for your heart disease, your allopurinol for your
gout, your albuterol and ipratropium for your COPD.

Brief Hospital Course:
71F with history of CHF, CAD, afib on coumadin, ESRD on HD and
COPD presenting with LLE cellulitis.
.
# Cellulitis - patient with chronic ulcers on left lower
extremity presented with inreased pain and erythema and elevated
WBC consistent with cellulitis.  She was recently treated for
cellulitis in that leg with vancomycin on previous
hospitalization in [**2194-1-28**]. After two days of vancomycin, she
had marked improvement in the leg with decreased erythema in
color and was dramatically receeding from the marked border
below the area. There was still [**12-1**]+pitting edema in the left
thigh, but improved compared to admission when it was harder and
was obscuring the anatomical markings of the knee on extension.
LENI of the leg was negative for DVT.  She was seen by vascular
surgery during this admission, who did not feel that surgery was
indicated and agreed with the proposed medical management.
-Vancomycin dosed with HD x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**])
-Ciprofloxacin 500mg po qday x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**])
.
#Hypotension - patient hypotensive to SBPs in 80s. In the ED
there was concern that she was possibly septic, so she was
admited to the ICU. She received 1.5L of IV fluids and her BP
repsonded well. Her baseline blood pressure is in the low 90s
systolic.  After being on the floor she continued to have lower
blood pressures and was asymptomatic with them.
-She will require monitoring of her blood pressure during
[**Month/Year (2) 2286**] sessions
.
# Afib - on amiodarone and coumadin as outpatient.  Stable.  INR
therapeutic at 2.1 on admission.  Continued on home medications
- cont warfarin and amiodarone
.
# CAD - Continued on amiodarone, pravastatin and SLNGT
.
# COPD - on spiriva, alubterol and fluticasone at home. Also
uses 2L NC at night at home. Has had cough for the past [**3-6**]
weeks and recently started on doxycycline on [**4-10**], which was
continued for planned 7 day course total and will be completed
on [**4-16**].  No worsening SOB.  CXR showed no evidence of PNA
.
# chronic sytolic CHF - Continued on home furosemide dose.
Patinet is not on ACEI prior to this admission, and this was not
started given her hypotension.
.
# ESRD - Continued on HD schedule of T-TH-SAT. She received an
extra ultrafiltration session on [**4-17**] (friday) to try to remove
more fluid from her left leg.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2130-2-3**] Mr. [**Known lastname 2302**] was admitted to the surgery service
under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with the diagnosis of a lower GI
bleed. His initial Hct was 28 and initial INR was 15. He was
admitted to the ICU and resuscitated. He was transfused 2 units
of PRBCs for a Hct of 22, and 2 units of FFP to reverse his
anticoagulation. He was also given Vitamin K. The following day
he was transfused 4 more units of PRBCs. The GI service was
consulted and 2 attempts were made to do a colonoscopy. Both
attempts were aborted due to a poor preparation. After 3 days in
the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 2303**] Hct was stable at 26-27. He was
transferred to the floor and given 1 more unit of PRBCs for
borderline urine output. His Hct then stabilized at 28-29. Since
he had no more episodes of bloody bowel movements, it was felt
that there was no need to make further attempts at colonoscopy.
His diet was then slowly advanced, physical therapy evaluated
the patient, and he was discharged to rehab on HD 7. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] from GI as well as his PCP regarding
his coumadin dose and INR checks. At the time of discharge he
was placed on coumadin 1mg Qhs (h/o PE and cardiac thrombus) and
his INR was 1.4. His Hct was 28.7.

his stool occasionally.  Three days prior to admission, pt had
an INR of 2.7 at coumadin clinic.  One day prior to presenation,
the patient self-started asacol from previous prescription
because worsening of rectal chrone's disease.  On day of
presentation, pt began having dark red bloody BMs, had ~15
episodes before calling EMS.  Upon ED arrival, had several
additional large bloody BMs.  He received vitamin K SQ, 2 FFP,
and 2 PRBC for stabilization of bleeding. BP was stable

the previous
tracing of [**2130-2-3**] the QRS width is wider and R wave reversal in
the lateral

myocardial
infarction. Clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Hematochezia/Crohn's: Likely [**1-12**] combination of known Crohn's
and overanticoagulation most likely due to drug interaction of
coumadin w/ sasacol. Received 2Units FFP and 1 unit PRBC + vit
K. With drop of Hct as low as 23.6, 27.0 upon d/c.  INR upon d/c
1.0.  Underwent colonoscopy showing ulcer in proximal ascending
colon which wx bx to exclude ulcerated neoplasia, chrohn's dz
which was bx, and pseudopolyps in the descending colon and
sigmoid colon.
.
## ARF: likely hypovolemia in setting of GIB, Cr of 1.6 from
baseline of 1.0. Currently back to baseline.
.
## Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: in sinus rhythm on [**Month/Day (2) 2304**].
- hold anticoag for now as risks outweigh benefits.  Will be
restarted w/ f/u w/ PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] control meds because of bleeding,
pt not in AF on [**Last Name (LF) 2304**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] restart BB w/ d/c to rehab facility.


## HTN: Meds held in setting of bleed, restarting OP meds w/ d/c
to rehab.  Holding lasix [**1-12**] to continued dehydration [**1-12**] to
poor PO intake.
.
## DCM: appears euvolemic
- hold furosemide in setting of GI bleed
.
## h/o PE, LV thrombus:
- hold anticoag in setting of GI bleed, will restart as
outpatient.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Lower GI Bleed


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
  You are being discharged from the hospital after an admission
for a lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Because of significant
blood loss, you were stabilized throughout the admission with
transfusion of blood products and clotting proteins.  You
underwent colonoscopy to evaluate for source of the bleeding.
It not only showed multiple areas of sick colon consistent with
your Chron's disease, but also a non-bleeding ulcer in the
bowel.  Multiple biopsy's were taken, results pending.  The most
likely cause of your bleeding is your very low ability to clot
due to a reaction between your blood thinner coumadin and the
asacol which you started.  Both medications are being stopped,
and only restarted after discussion between your PCP and your
Gastroenterologist.
   After being evaluated by Physical Therapy, it is felt that
you would benefit from a short stay in an acute rehab facility
to help improve your strength after this hospitalization.

Followup Instructions:
Follow up w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 216**] in [**12-12**] weeks ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1300**]

[**2131-7-10**]: ECHO
LA is normal in size. No ASD is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric LV hypertrophy. LV cavity is moderately
dilated. There is a sessile mural thrombus at the LV apex; the
clot is mural and not mobile. Overall LV systolic function is
moderately-to-severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to
severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral
walls, and extensive apical akinesis. There is no VSD. RV
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. AV leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but AS is not
present. Mild (1+) AR is seen. MV leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no MVP. Mild (1+) MR is seen. LV inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated PA systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2130-2-3**], a LV apical
thrombus is now present

[**2131-7-9**] Stress Test:
IMPRESSION: No significant ST-T wave changes in the setting of
baseline
ST-T wave abnormalities. No anginal-type symptoms. Nuclear
report sent
separately.

[**2131-7-9**] PMIBI:
IMPRESSION: 1. Abnormal study. 2. Severe, fixed perfusion defect
involving the inferior wall and the a large region at the apex.
3. Moderately dilated LV. 4. Akinetic apex and inferior wall
with LVEF 28%.

[**2131-7-9**] MRI Abdomen
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypodense flat subcapsular lesion within segment IV-B on
prior CT from [**2131-7-6**], demonstrates a slight delayed
enhancement; however gross stability since [**2129-4-9**] CT abdomen
and pelvis suggest a benign lesion. This lesion is amenable to
further evaluation by targeted ultrasound, possibly with biopsy,
as clinically indicated.
2. Vague 1.3 cm lesion in segment 7 on prior CT from [**2131-7-6**]
is not clearly visualized. However, this examination is motion
limited and a small lesion within this vicinity cannot entirely
be excluded.
3. Filling defect in the lower common bile duct suggests
choledocholithiasis without evidence of acute obstruction.

[**2131-7-6**] CT chest/abd/pelvis w/ w/o contrast
1) 3.7 cm irregular soft tissue mass at the lateral aspect of
the ascending colon, associated with lymph nodes, corresponding
to the colon cancer seen on colonoscopy. Small amount of fluid
along the right paracolic gutter, probably due to biopsy. 2)
Featureless appearance of the descending and sigmoid colon, with
increased wall thickening and fat stranding in the descending
colon, suggestive of active inflammation due to Crohn's disease.

3) Ill-defined 1.3 cm lesion in the segment 7 of the liver, for
which metastasis is suspected given the colon cancer. Further
evaluation by multiphasic MRI is recommended.
4) Unchanged nodular appearance of the left adrenal gland. The
finding can be evaluated at the time of MRI as well.
6) New bilateral pleural effusion.
7) Increased mucosal enhancement in the perianal region, with
probable perianal fistula on the right, new since prior study.
8) Multiple hypodense lesions in the kidney, unchanged since
prior study.

Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
57 yo F with PMHX of HTN who presents with shortness of breath x
7 days, worsening over the last 3 days. Patient reports that she
has been feeling weak over the last 3 weeks with an
unintentional 10 lb weight loss (of note over the last 2 months
she has lost 20lbs).  1 week ago she started feeling SOB with
exertion, and "hot and cold" but no fevers chills.  Then 3 days
ago she began to have a non-productive cough that left her
"gasping for air", worse at night, with "belly racing", (which
appears to be belly breathing when pt demonstrates this).
Patient denies nausea, vomiting, chest pain, night sweats, but
does endorse a poor appetite. She reports that food has been
tasting bland over the last week and that she will only eat food
that's "really tasty" like [**Location (un) 86**] Market, but most of the time
she just has soup at home.  Of note, patient also reports that 2
weeks ago she had burning on urination for 7 days that went away
spontaneously.  She also reports that over the last 3 days she
has been having more watery stools than normal, but no more
frequent BM's than usual.  Patient attributed the loose stools
to her being ill "it's what happens when I get sick."
Today was seen by NP[**Company 2316**], found to have decreased breath
sounds throughout, HR of 120, O2 sat of 70%, increased to 84% on
2L, so was sent to the ED.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 110 120/80 28 86% 6L (to 100% on
NRB). On exam, shallow breathing and tachypneic but mild degree
of respiratory distress. Flu swab ordered. EKG showed ***. CXR
showed atypical pneumonia vs PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 2317**], ordered for
azithromycin, but unclear if given. Got 1 liter IVF on way out
of ED. Access is 18g and 20g PIV. Temp 97.6 96 120/70 37 99,NRB.
.
On the floor, patient reported feeling "much better", and when
asked what had caused her improvement she reported that it was
"the oxygen, definitely".
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI; otherwise she reports a small flat skin
discoloration in spots on her L upper extremity

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-2-11**] 10:44 AM
IMPRESSION: Diffuse hazy opacities within both lungs, without
evidence for volume overload. Findings are most concerning for a
diffuse infectious process, likely with atypical organisms. If
the patient is immunocompromised, PCP should be considered.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission there was high index of suspicion for PCP given the
appearance on chest x-ray and a significant amount of
oropharyngeal thrush. Bronchoscopy with BAL on [**2190-2-12**] was
positive for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was presumptively started on Bactrim and
Prednisone treatment in the emergency department. She was
consented for HIV testing and it came back positive with a
viral load (VL) of 114,000 and a CD4 of 8. Her oxygenation was
tenuous initially requiring face mask with desaturation to the
high 70 with movement to the commode but she did not require
intubation. Over the course of her treatment she was transition
ed to face tent and eventually to 4-5 L of oxygen via nasal
cannula. Her overall oxygenation minimally improved very slowly
despite Bactrim with a prolonged steroid taper. She was finally
discharged home with O2 supplementation of [**3-2**] L to keep O2 sat
at 94 % at rest. Her hypoxia was related to the PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
For confirmation, she underwent CTA of the lung which was
negative for pulmonary embolism. The CT did show diffuse ground
glass opacities as well as lymphadenopathy without effusions
consistent with the diagnosis of PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2321**] her exertional
hypoxia, she remained well with minimal symptoms (only mild
dyspnea with activity but no significant cough and no fever or
chest pain). Patient remained in the hospital for several extra
days hoping that her hypoxia will improve. It did remain stable
at the above level without any additional symptoms (4-5 L at
rest with O2 sat at 94 with decrease to 87-85 with activity.
Without oxygen, her O2 sat will decrease to 76 with activity).
In regards to the new diagnosis of AIDS(AIDS defining illness
and CD4 of 8), her toxoplasma IgG was positive. She was started
on azithromycin for [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis. ID was consulted and will
follow her closely as an outpatient ( 3 days after discharge).
HIV genotyping was sent and was pending at the time of
discharge. The patient has a history of hypertension and was
continued on home dose of Atenolol 50 mg daily.  BP was well
controlled despite holding amlodipine/chlorthalidone and these
were NOT restarted on discharge. She did have elevation of her
liver function tests on presentation. Work up included negative
hepatitis serologies and RUQ ultrasound (mild fatty
infiltration). LFTs abnormalities were related to PCP pneumonia,
fatty liver, or both. Blood AFB culture and HCV viral loads are
pending and will be followed by her ID. She was discharged home
without VNA, the latter would offer little help as she had no to
minimal symptoms. Total discharge time 56 minutes.

.
Scope ENT (on admission): Her glottic opening is about 4mm on
scope exam without symptoms including stridor or retraction.
.
CT neck with contrast ([**2105-4-16**]): Retropharyngeal fluid
collection spanning from C2/3 to C5/6 with extensive surrounding
edema and inflammation of the hypopharynx. The airway is
narrowed to 4mm at the level of the hyoid. Patent cervical
vasculature.
.
CXR ([**2105-4-17**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there
is no relevant change. No pathologic mediastinal widening.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. Presence of minimal
pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No focal parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia. No pulmonary edema.
.
CT neck and chest w/ contrast ([**2105-4-18**]):
1. Interval slight decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid
collection and
improved airway patency.
2. No evidence of Lemierre's disease or new abscess formation.

3. No evidence of extension of the fluid collection into the
mediastinum. No evidence of mediastinitis.
.
Chest CT ([**4-22**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Rapidly enlarging multiloculated right pleural effusion. This
could be due to empyema considering clinical suspicion for this
entity, but definitive diagnosis would require correlation with
thoracentesis results.
2. Small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in
size since the prior study but does not have loculated
components.
3. Slight increase in size of pre- and sub-carinal lymph nodes
as well as right hilar nodes. These are likely reactive.
4. Ground-glass opacities in left upper lobe which are likely
infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
.
TTE ([**4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**4-23**] CXR
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with
complicated pleural
effusion.

Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison
to [**2105-4-21**].

There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, loculated,
better
appreciated on the prior radiograph but the change in size is
significant. No pneumothorax is seen. Left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo F with PMHX of HTN presenting with sore throat, neck pain,
and odynophagia found to have epiglottis and retrophargyneal
phlegmon.
.
#Epiglottis/retropharyngenal phlegmon: Diagnosed on CT neck and
by ENT scope. Symptoms consistent with this. The patient did
improve clinically with steroids, Ceftriaxone and clindamycin.
The patient's airway was closely monitored in the ICU and
underwent repeat ENT scoping on [**2105-4-18**] that showed ongoing
arytenoid edema but completely patent airway. Repeat CT neck and
chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck
pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous
lesion (see below), did not show Lemierre's or mediastinitis.
There was minimal interval improvement in the phlegmon
collection, however. Blood cultures from admission were positive
for GNRs, later grew out HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE. Planned for 14
day course from day of first negative culture. The patient
remained hemodynamically stable and re-evaluation by ENT in the
ICU showed improved of supraglottic swelling so she was
transfered to the floor. Repeat cultures were negative ???? HIV
was sent and was negative. Patient continued to be symptom free
on the floor and did not have any further airway complaints or
problems. She was treated symptomatically with cepacol lozenges
and was kept on a nicotine patch and received nebulizers PRN.
.
#Erythematous lesion: Patient developed a 3X3 inch erythematous
lesion on her anterior chest, 2 inches below cricoid and poorly
demarcated. The patient endorsed feeling warm and mildly tender
to palpation in this area with no pruritis. No
plaques/papules/bullae. The lesion was very blanching.
Dermatology was consulted on [**2105-4-18**] given spread of this
lesion to ~4X4 inches despite broadening to Vancomycin. Given
the timing of her antibiotics, this lesion was not felt due to
drug eruption, although a very early drug eruption can not be
ruled out. The erythema was felt most consistent with a toxic
exanthem, which is a vasodilation that occurs in patients with
bactermia (more often staph, strep). Supportive care was
provided. Derm followed patient while in house. by hospital day
4 the rash had significantly receeded. Derm did not feel
compelled to biopsy - they thought it was likely due to her
infectious process but did not represent a cellulitis. Her rash
improved later in her hospital course.
.
#Pneumonia and pleural effusion: She was noted to have
intermittent hypoxemia and R sided pleuritic chest pain on [**4-20**].
Medicine was consulted on [**4-22**], and in setting of new moderate
pleural effusions R>L on CXR, recommended chest CT, which showed
rapidly expanding and loculated effusion on R. She was then
transferred to medicine, and ID was consulted. Her antibiotics
were changed to ceftriaxone. Her pleural effusion was attempted
to be drained by IR, but they only withdrew 30 cc of fluid,
given loculation. Thoracic surgery was then involved and carried
out a VATS procedure which was uncomplicated and the patient was
transferred back to medicine.
.
#Hypertension: Blood pressures normal and intermittently high
(SBPs 150s) in-house. The patient's atenolol, lipitor were held
in the setting of epiglottis/retropharyngeal phlegmon but
restarted once she was able to tolerate POs. Atenolol was
initially started at half home dose 50mg, then back to her full
dose.However due to asymp. bradycardia into the 40's atenolol
was discontinued ad replaced with Chlorthalidone on [**4-25**].
.
# Intermittent bradycardia to 40s, asymptomatic: She was
monitored on telemetry with occasional intermittent bradycardia
to the 40s. her EKG was otherwise normal, without AVB. TTE was
done which showed no HD significant pericardial effusion,
abscess, or vegetations. Her bradycardia may have been due to
vagal tone in setting of pleural effusions and pleuritic pain.
.
# Lower extremity edema: She noted increased edema during this
admission. She had some baseline edema as a flight attendant but
only while standing for long durations. She had no JVD or HJR,
and TTE was normal.
.
#PPX: Heparin sq

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year old man who is a retired anethesiologist with
h/o CAD s/p CABG and ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25% who
was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] following a hospital course
for gallstone pancreatitis and now re-presents from rehab for
fevers.  During last admission, he was transferred from OSH with
with fever and pancreatitis which was thought to be from
gallstones although there were no gallstones in the bile ducts,
just in the gallbladder itself.  CT scan done on admissionw as
consistent with severe pancreatitis.  ERCP was done on [**2198-4-6**],
with sphinceterotomy and CBD stent placed.  His post procedure
course was complicated by fevers and repeat CT abd shows
progression of severe pancreatitis with extensive
peripancreatitis fluid collection.  This was thought to be
either from PNA or from inflammation from his pancreatitis.  He
finished a course of azithro/ctx and a course of flagyl/cipro
and eventually he devefesced.  All cultures were negative.  He
was discharged to rehab.

associated bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Effusions slightly
larger than on [**2198-2-8**].

CXR:
Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased. Moderate
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable. Upper lungs
grossly clear. Atelectasis at the lung bases is slightly more
severe today. No pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial pacer
and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are unchanged in
their respective positions. The patient is status post median
sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old man with CAD s/p CABD and ischemic cardiomyopathy EF
25% who was recently admitted for gallstone pancreatitis, now
re-admitted from rehab for fevers.
.
# FEVERS: Likely source is from his pancreas.  On last
admission, he was febrile without an identified infectious
source and was thought to be from inflammatory response to
pancreatitis and peri-pancreatic fluid.  Currently with
leukocytosis and left shift although no localizing signs of
infection.  The differential at this time includes (infected)
pancreatic pseudocyst, necrotizing pancreatitis and an
obstructed bile duct stent.

================================================================
Surgery was then consulted and he went to the OR on [**4-24**] for his
Infected pancreatic necrosis, status post gallstone
pancreatitis. He had
1.  Exploratory laparotomy.
2.  Pancreatic debridement with wide drainage.
3.  Open cholecystectomy.
4.  Placement of a combined G/J tube (MIC tube).

Post-op he stayed in the ICU for 2 nights and was trasnfered to
the floor on POD 3.

GI/Abd: He was NPO with a NGT and IVF. The NGT was removed on
POD 2. His G-tube was left to gravity drainage.
His J-tube was capped and then trophic tubefeedings were started
on POD 2. His tubefeedings were advanced to a goal of Replete
with Fiber 3/4 strength at 80cc/hr.
He had 3 JP drains in place and these were draining thick, dark
fluid.
He continued to have high output from these drains.
He was started on sips on POD 5, he was advanced to clears on
POD 6.
JP amylase was checked on POD 7, once on a full liquid diet. His
JP Amylase was 27K, 34K, and 14K. He was made NPO due to his JP
amylase reported as high. He continued on the tubefeedings. A
grape juice test was positive for a leak from around the JP
drains.
He had one small spot with minimal drainage that could be
expressed from his incision.
His is now having drainage around all his drains and g/j tube
with mild skin irritation. He has irritation around the tube
extending out from ~0.5 - 3 cm and appears at [**Doctor First Name **] to develop
yeast. His midline incision is c/i but has a small amount of
serous drainage on the gauze.

Have suggested using Criticaid anti fungal moisture barrier to
protect his skin from the drainage and to prevent the formation
of yeast. Continue to apply a thin layer of dressing around the
drains and change as needed do not allow the gauze to become
saturated with drainage. Apply the antifungal Criticaid two to
three times/day.


A CT was obtained on [**5-5**] and showed:
1. Heterogeneity in the region of the pancreas consistent with
the patient's previous necrotizing pancreatitis.
2. Three surgical drains in situ with some high attenuation in
the region of the lesser sac which may represent fistulization
from the small bowel into this residual collection.
3. Loculated fluid under the anterior abdominal wall measuring
16 cm.
4. Gastrojejunostomy in situ.
5. Renal cysts.
6. Bilateral pleural effusions.
7. Enlarged prostate at 8 cm.
.
He will remain NPO with TF for 2 weeks and then return for a
repeat CT. His drains will remain and the drainage will be
monitored.

Pain: He had good pain control with a PCA. He continued on a PCA
thru POD 6. Once back on a diet, he was ordered for PO pain meds
with good control.

Labs: We monitored his labs and his Tbili decreased from a high
of 2.6 on POD 2 to WNL by [**2198-4-28**].

Cards: He was being followed by his PCP/Cardiologist. He was put
back on his home meds on POD5, including Lasix IV for gentle
diuresis and his heart meds.

Renal: He was diuresing well and continued to have negative
fluid balance and losing weight appropriately.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP x 2
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 year old woman with PMH of ESRD on HD, HTN,
and DM, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**7-21**] with complaint of
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea x 3 days. The
patient also reported recent fever and chills.  In  the ED,
patient had a low grade temperature of 100.5 degrees.  Her
abdomen was slightly distended, with no rigidity or rebound.
Admission laboratory data were notable for WBC 6.2, elevated
transaminases, and INR 3.7.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound
disclosed a 5 mm gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder.
There was also a 5mm  gallstone in the common bile duct, without
ductal dilatation.  The patient was evaluated by surgery for her
choledocholithiasis.  The patient was also seen by the ERCP
fellow.  The patient was not acutely ill last night, so she was
admitted to the Medicine team, with plan for ERCP today. She was
kept NPO and was administered IVF overnight.
  This morning, she was administered 4 U FFP to reverse her INR.
 After receiving 2 U FFP, she became hypoxic, with O2 sats
dropping to the 70s.  She was placed on 100% NRB with
improvement in her O2 sats to the 90s. Prior to dialysis, she
was given 100 mg IV Lasix, with urine output (non measured).  At
1:50 PM, she was transferred to the Hemodialysis Unit for
initiation of hemodialysis.  Approximately 1 L was removed, yet
the patient remained in respiratory distress, with O2 sats in
the low 90s on NRB.  At 2:30 PM, a respiratory code was called
since patient's O2 sats dropped to 70s on the NRB.  The patient
was emergently intubated.  ABG prior to intubation was
7.21/55/55.  EKG disclosed new ST segment depressions in the

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory Failure: On HD#2, the patient developed acute
respiratory distress.  The patient had recieved IVF in the ED
the nigtht before and that monring had recieved 4 units of FFP
for planned ERCP, the last two within one hour of respiratory
distress.  CXR demonstrated acute developement of bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates.  Ddx included cardiogenic pulmonary edema
versus TRALI.  The patient was taken for emergent HD; however,
depspite succesful diuresis, the patient required intubation for
respiratory failure.  TRALI work-up is pending at the time of
discharge.  The patient remained intubated in the MICU and
succesfully extubated on the second attempt.

2. Hypotension: After intubation, the patient became hypotensive
in the MICU requiring initiation of pressors.  She was found to
be adrenally insufficent by cortisyn stimulation test and
started on stress-dose hydrocortisone and fludircortisone.  In
addition, she required pressors and continued IV Unasyn for
possible sepsis, though blood cultures were negative.  The
patient's blood pressure improved and stablized.

3. Choledocholithasis: Demonstrated on admission RUQ US on
admission without transaminitis but with low-grade fever and
left-shift.  The patient was evaluted by Surgery and ERCP
service.  She was started on IV Unasyn.  Patient underwent ERCP
in MICU while intubated, which demonstrated dilated CBD but no
stones.  Patient had spinchterotomy.  The patient completed a 10
day course of IV Unsyn and will be discharged on two days.
Consideration should be given to possible outpatient
cholecystetomy.

4. GI Bleed: Post-ERCP, the patient dropped Hct and was foudn to
be guiac postitive.  Patient underwent repeat ERCP which
demonstrated spincterotomy bleed.  This required epiniephrine
injection.  Hct remained relatively stable, though she had a
possible rebleed several days later which stablized without
repeat scope.  ASA and coumadin were held [**2-3**] bleed and may be
safely restarted on [**2127-8-4**].  The patient's Hct remained stable
for the rest of her hospital course.  The patient will continue
on her PPI.

5. Coronary Artery Disease: During the patient's MICU stay, EKG
was noted to have
poor R wave progression.  An echocardiogram was obtained which
demonstrated regional LV dysfunction suggesting CAD.  Cardiac
enzymes demonstrated non-diagnostic elevated Tropnin T, felt
either secondary to demand or ESRD.  ASA was held [**2-3**] GI bleed
and the patient's beta-blocker was continued.  The patient will
need an outpatient evaluation of her coronaries, likely with ETT
MIBI when she is stable.  Again, ASA will be started [**2127-8-4**].

6. ESRD: The patient did well on her hemodilyasis schedule.  The
patient's prednisone was continued for her history of renal
vascultitis.

7. Hypothryoidism: Patient stable on levothyroxine.

History of Present Illness:
A [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with past medical history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent
admission [**Date range (1) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure
with decision to initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital
stay complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia
presenting with altered mental status.  Per her daughter, the
patient was home this past week and accidentally took trazodone
50 mg two days prior to admission, which had been discontinued
due to confusion.  Her confusion/visual hallucinations improved
the day prior to admission.  She complained of increased
productive cough and oxygen requirement (previously intermittent
2L NC, now continuous) over the past two days, responding to an
increase in nebulizer treatments.  The patient was noted to be
lethargic this afternoon, responsive to sternal rub.  When
aroused, she was oriented x 3 and moving all extremities well,
however.  The patient was noted to be "cold."  She has not
complained of recent fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema around line.
.
In the ED, initial VS T 96, HR 63, BP 77/55, RR 18 SaO2 98%
(oxygen not documented).  Per report, patient had poor
respiratory effort, became apneic, and was subsequently
intubated.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and left
lower lobe pneumonia.  Head CT negative for acute process.  A
right femoral line was placed for access.  She was given
etomidate and roccuronium for intubation, vancomycin 1 gm IV x
1, zosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1, 1L NS.  The patient was started on
levophed for hypotension peri-intubation, off within half an
hour.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is responsive to tactile stimuli.

1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Left frontal encephalomalacia with probable slight further
involution.
3. Left maxillary sinus disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical history of COPD,
Wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease,
recent admission [**Date range (3) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal
failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower
lobe Moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella
pneumonia and sepsis.

1)Moraxella pneumonia: Most likely explanation for respiratory
failure/hypotension in ED requiring intubation.  She was
successfully extubated on [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2
via NC without e/o respiratory distress.  Her sputum culture
from [**2131-12-24**] is again growing Moraxella, no other new
organisms.  CXR continues to show same LLL infiltrate concerning
for partially treated pneumonia.  Concerning for endobronchial
lesion with postobstructive pneumonia however chest CT did not
show any underlying structural cause for recurrance of
pneumonia.  She did have bilateral pleural effusions which
appeared simple and did not appear to be parapneumonic.  She was
initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn however this was
changed to ceftriaxone once culture data returned with
moraxella.  She improved daily from a repiratory standpoint and
was on minimal to no oxygen on discharge.  She was changed to
cefpodoxime on discharge to be given only on hemodialysis days,
after dialysis as this antibiotic is renally cleared.

2)Altered mental status: Likely delirium in the setting of
infection, sedating meds, ICU stay especially in setting of
advanced age.  In addition, daughter reports that she took
trazodone two days prior to admission, which has caused
confusion in the past.  She had a CT head on admission without
acute process.  Her mental status cleared during her hospital
stay and treatment of pneumonia.

3)Coagulopathy: Her INR was 2 on admission, however climbed to
peak of 5.3 likley due to poor nutrition and antibiotics.  Her
coumadin was stopped [**12-25**] and held throughout the remainder of
her admission.  She was restarted on 1mg coumdain on discharge
with INR checks with dialysis. Her INR was 2.9 on the day of
discharge.

4)Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis. Decision
made to initiate HD last admission.  She was dialysed for volume
overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for
dialysis at FMC - West Suburban Dialysis Center.  She was
continued on epogen with dialysis, nephrocaps, calcitriol,
calcium.

5)Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission;
prior to that was in the low 30s. No signs or symptoms of active
bleeding, guaiac negative.   She was transfused one unit PRBC
with dialysis on [**12-26**] with stable hematocrit around 26
throughout the remainder of her hospitalization.  She should be
continued on epogen with dialysis.

6)Diarrhea - patient has developed diarrhea in setting of
multiple admissions and antibiotics.  She had one stool that was
negative for C. diff and was started on loperamide to decrease
stool output given skin breakdown.  She was also advised to eat
yogurt three times daily.  Diarrhea is most likely antibiotic
associated due to alteration of normal bowel flora, however she
will require two additional stool samples to rule out C.diff.
She will require monitoring of in's and out's and encouragement
for oral intake to prevent dehydration.

7)Skin Breakdown: During her admission she began developing skin
breakdown on her gluteal cleft likely due to a combination of
immobility due to acute illness and diarrhea as discussed above.
 She will require close monitoring of her skin and frequent
personal care to keep her buttocks clean and protected.

8)Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  Her metoprolol was initially
held in the ICU given sinus bradycardia and sepsis.  It was
resumed at home dose on [**12-26**] however given borderline blood
pressures, it was decreased to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-27**].

9) Spiculated lesion on CT chest: as discussed in radiology
report, will need repeat CT in 3 months to reassess this lesion
for stability.

10)Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine

11)Code: Full

You were intubated and sent to the ICU for care.  You improved
and were able to be extubated the following day.  You were
treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and your breathing
improved.  You had blood cultures, urine cultures and stool
cultures which did not show any evidence of infection.

You had dialysis with fluid removal as you were given a large
amount of IV fluids on admission for your infection which caused
swelling in your arms and fluid around your lungs.

You developed diarrhea during your admission which is most
likely due to antibiotics.  You were started on loperamide to
attempt to decrease the diarrhea and to prevent further skin
breakdown.

Medications:
1)You will be discharged on cefpodoxime to complete a 2 week
course of antibiotics.  This should be taken only on dialysis
days, after your dialysis.
2)You can take loperamide as needed to decrease your diarrhea.
3)Your coumadin was held during your admission but can be
restarted on discharge as your INR was down to 2.9.
4)Your metoprolol was decreased to 75mg twice daily as your
blood pressure was borderline low.
No other changes were made to your medications.

Please follow up as below.

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you have
any concerning symptoms including fevers, confusion, chest pain,
trouble breathing, low blood pressure or other worrisome
symptoms.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chronic right ankle infection with unstable
joint.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old male with
a nonhealing right malleolar wound and fracture for the last
2 years who underwent a right ankle traction and open
reduction internal fixation. The patient has had multiple
admissions for wound infections and multiple IV antibiotic
courses. Most recent admission was [**2189-9-28**], for a
wound infection. The patient recently complained of a
temperature elevation on [**2189-11-30**], and now is to be
admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] service for continued IV
antibiotics. The patient initially was discharged on
daptomycin and followed by VNA.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes with triopathy,
endstage renal disease secondary to diabetes, status post
cadaver transplant in [**2182**], history of coronary artery
disease, status post CABG in [**2178**], history of peripheral

open reduction internal fixation, status post hardware
removal, chronic osteomyelitis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Percocet, dicloxacillin 100 mg twice a day,
gabapentin 1600 mg twice a day, Lasix 20 mg twice a day,
Sensipar 30 mg daily, metoprolol 25 mg daily, ranitidine 150
mg daily. There are two other medications that the patient is
on, of which the handwriting is not decipherable at this
time.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker, is married and
lives with his spouse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 94.6, 94, 18, blood
pressure 144/88, oxygen saturation 93% in room air. Blood
sugar fingerstick was 291 on admission. General appearance:
Alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress. HEENT
exam: Mild right eye ptosis. Neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy or carotid bruits. Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Chest is with a well healed median
sternotomy incision. Heart is a regular rate and rhythm with
a systolic ejection murmur II/VI, nonradiating. Abdomen is
soft, nontender, obese. Extremities: Right malleolus with
punctate lesion with draining and surrounding erythema. Pulse
exam shows palpable radial pulses, femoral pulses
bilaterally. The right DP and PT are dopplerable signals. The
left DP and PT are dopplerable signs. Neurological exam is
nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. His dicloxacillin was continued. Vancomycin and
Flagyl were instituted. He was continued on his preadmission
medications. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] and advisement was
made for him to undergo a below the knee amputation. The
patient accepted the recommendation. Transplant nephrology
was consulted to follow the patient during his
hospitalization. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for hyperglycemic
management. Daily SK5 levels were obtained. He required
minimal adjustment in his immunosuppression. He continued on
his Lantus with a Humalog sliding scale with improvement in
his glycemic control. On [**2189-12-3**], he underwent a
right BKA without incident. He was transferred to the PACU in
stable condition. At the end of his surgical procedure
intraoperatively, the patient became hypotensive with
systolic blood pressure in the 60s and he was given Neo 200
mcg x2 and epinephrine 5 mg x2. The patient went into a
monomorphic VT 4 minutes at a rate of 130. He was given
lidocaine 100 mg IV bolus and amiodarone 125 mg over 15
minutes. The patient converted to sinus rhythm. An
intraoperative TEE showed severe biventricular failure.
Dopamine was started at 5 mcg/kg/minute. Blood pressure
improved. He was transferred to the PACU and then to the ICU
for continued care. Serial enzymes were obtained. Repeat echo
was obtained on the 28th which demonstrated left ventricular
wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained by 2-D
images. He has severely depressed left ventricular ejection
fraction. He had multiple regional wall motion abnormalities.
His aortic valve was moderately thickened leaflets. There
were no masses or vegetations on the aortic valve. No aortic
insufficiency. The mitral valve, tricuspid valve were normal
with trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. The pulmonic valve and artery were
unremarkable. The pericardium showed no pleural effusion.
Aortic valve area was calculated at 1.3 cm squared, normal is
3 cm squared. Gradient peak was 32 mm. There was no
intracardiac thrombus noted on the primary or the secondary
echo. The ejection fraction was calculated at 30% to 40%. IV
heparin was begun to maintain a goal PTT between 40 and 60.
The patient's Dobutamine was weaned with hopes to extubate.
Pulse exam remained unchanged. The right amputation site was
clean dry dressing. He remained on bedrest in the SICU.
Cardiac enzymes: Base was 20, peaked at 96 for the CK. CK MBs
were not obtained. His troponins were 0.01 and 0.03. The
patient's Swan was converted to a CVL on [**2189-12-4**].
The patient continued on heparin, was extubated and
transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care on
[**2189-12-5**]. Cardiology was requested to see the
patient on [**2189-12-6**], who felt the patient was
hemodynamically stable and his atrial fibrillation was rate
controlled. We should continue the heparin while his INR is
less than 2 and his goal INR should be [**1-9**], and recommend
metoprolol tartrate twice a day versus single dosing. They
recommended aspirin 81 mg and simvastatin 20 mg daily.
Hyperglycemia control remained relatively good. He did not
require adjustment in his Lantus. His premeal coverage was
adjusted. Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were
discontinued on [**2189-12-7**]. The patient remained
afebrile. Foley was discontinued. Peripheral line was placed
and the central line was discontinued. The patient had been
advanced to a regular diet and ambulation to chair was begun.
On [**2189-12-8**], postoperative day 5, the patient
continues on IV heparin/Coumadinization conversion. Serial
coags were monitored. Physical therapy will see the patient
and make recommendations regarding disposition planning,
being a new amputation if he will go to rehabilitation. Will
talk to infectious disease, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2379**], regarding discontinue
the doxycycline. The remaining hospital course, the patient
will be discharged when medically stable and bed available at
rehabilitation. At the time of discharge, discharge
medication instructions will be dictated.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
Direct transfer from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for STEMI, cath and
now stablized hct and transfered out of CCU

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Blood transfusion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2391**] is a 66-year-old male with hx HIV on HAART,
lymphoma, LUL lung adenocarcinoma s/p resection, hx CAD s/p PCI
with DES in [**5-17**] to proximal circumflex artery. In [**11-16**] he had
elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of
previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent.
Mid-RCA was 80% occluded and treated with DES as well. In [**2-18**]
pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass
graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft. His plavix
was discontinued at that time. He was recently admitted on
[**2188-4-30**] w/ STEMI over III, F, taken to cath, where he had a DES
placed in the LCX for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus
proximally. Of note, at cath [**4-30**], he had a totally occluded
right external iliac artery. The pt was discharged home [**2188-5-3**].
Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the
exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery,
bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night. He stated
he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he
developed a "cold rough" feeling in his esophagus similar to his
pain that he had with all of his prior MIs. He states it was a
[**5-24**] in severity. He took 1 nitro, and it resolved. He reports
he did not take his plavix yesterday and today. He noted
intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which
felt like "gas pain", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no
vomiting. He states the feeling returned and then persisted,
took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a [**2192-2-16**]. He
called 911.
.
In the ambulance, the pt's pain decr to [**1-25**] and he received
ASA, another nitro en route. His pain, however, only resolved
completely on nitro gtt at OSH where he was given ASA, IV
integrillin, IV heparin, started on nitro drip with full
resolution of pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. His
initial BP at OSH 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro. Outside
labs with CK 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, BNP
17.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath. In the
cath lab: LCX was totally occluded within proximal stents. A
wire was passed and flow was reestablished (likely development
of blood clots). 1 additional bare metal stent (no DES since he
had questionable compliance w/ plavix) placed distal to last
stent. Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches. Cath
was performed via radial artery (per lower ext arterial
disease). His right groin (femoral vein) developed a hematoma.
His left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post
surgery 2 months ago. He was subsequently transferred to the
floor. He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found
to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath HCT). He is being
transferred to the CCU for unstable HCT and hematoma with labile
BP s/p catheterization today.
.
Brief CCU event: CT scan of abd neg for RP bleed. Neg groin for
psuedoaneurysm. Stable hct. Received total of 3 units of blood.
2 unit pRBC for hct 27 ([**5-9**]) -> 31.6 ([**5-10**] Am)-> 29.5-> 28.2

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with HIV, CAD, recently admitted for STEMI
found to have 100% LCX lesion and stented w/ DES, who presented
with STEMI to OSH, and found to have total occlusion of proximal
LCX stent, now s/p bare metal stent placement. Pt was then found
to have a hematocrit drop and hypotension necessitating
transfuse to CCU, now stabilized.
.
Blood loss: Pt was s/p catheterization with R wrist for arterial
access and R groin for venous access. CT scan was performed, and
ruled out RP bleed and U/S ruled out AV fistula and
pseudoaneurysm. He received a total of 3 units PRBCs in CCU, and
his hct has been stable. Pt likely had blood loss during cath,
and in groin hematoma. After being transferred back to the floor
from the CCU, his Hct was stable. Low-dose metoprolol was
started the night before discharge, and he tolerated this with
SBP in the 100s to 110s.
.
Cardiac. Patient was admitted with a repeat STEMI secondary to
instent thrombosis. He had placement of a bare metal stent, and
was started on higher doses of plavix at 150 mg daily. He was
continued on aspirin and a high dose statin as well. His
antihypertensives were held due to hypotension, and restarted
prior to discharge.
He was not diuresed further, despite an elevated PCWP of 28 at
catheterization, due to hypotension. He remained in normal sinus
rhythm.
.
Hyperbilirubinemia: the pt was noted to have mild jaundice and
scleral icterus on [**5-12**]. LFTs were checked and his total
bilirubin was 6.6, direct bili was 0.2. His other LFTs were
normal. His hemolysis labs were normal. The hyperbilirubinemia
was felt to be most likely due to either reabsorption of the
large hematoma or a side effect from one of his HIV meds, most
likely atazanavir. His bilirubin continued to climb but he was
otherwise asymptomatic. A RUQ U/S showed small gallstones but no
evidence of cholecystitis or obstruction. His statin and HIV
meds were stopped on discharge.
.
HIV: Patient was continued on his outpatient HIV medications. He
was continued on prophylactic bactrim. He was continued on his
antidepressants.
.
Dispo. Patient was discharged to home with a stable hematocrit.

Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F Russian-speaking h/o refractory nodular sclerosing Hodgkins
Lymphoma was brought in by EMS and admitted after her home
health care aide noted she was hypotensive to 88/40 and
confused.

In the ED, T 98.4 (rectal), HR 101, BP 102/53, RR 20, O2Sat 98%
on 3L. Incontinant of guaiac-positive stool.  Treated with 4 L
NS, vanco 1g IV, ceftazadime 1g IV, and flagyl 500mg IV.
Received 0.5 mg ativan and 2mg IV morphine for agitation.

Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she completed a 10-day course of
ceftazadime and vancomycin for urosepsis. A 7-day course of
metronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C.
Diff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count,
although all C. Diff assays were negative. Pt was stabilized and
was transferred to the floor for further care. At the time of
transfer, active issues were poor nutritional status,
thrombocytopenia and anemia.

On the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib
with RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as
respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.
There was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she
had pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt
digoxin was not recommended.

Pt was therefore readmitted to the MICU.  While in the MICU, she
was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam as she had
(1) sites of possible infection at the erosions under her
breasts and on her right hip, as well as question of PNA, (2)
rising WBC, reaching a high of nearly 17.  MICU course was also
marked by (1) hypotension, which responded to gentle NS boluses;
(2) low UOP believed to be [**2-22**] both hypovolemia and a low
baseline nitrogenous load/obligate urine output; and (3)
recurrent Afib, for which she was transitioned to amiodarone
400mg PO daily, to run for 7 days before titrating downward.

Pertinent Results:
[**1-8**] - CXR - IMPRESSION: Persistent right-sided effusion. No
definite consolidation. Routine PA and lateral films are
recommended for evaluation when feasible.

[**1-10**].  Echo.
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (probably 3) are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Based on [**2193**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2190-12-22**], there is no definite change.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma initially
admitted for urosepsis, and who was transferred to the ICU with
hypotension and AFib with RVR.

# Goals of Care: The patient had a long hospital course with
many family meetings reagarding goals of care.  On [**2194-1-21**] the
patient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU
transfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the
patient.  The patient was tranferred to the unit on [**2194-1-30**].
She was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a
decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.
 Care was not escalated and she expired at 14:26 on [**2194-2-2**].
The family declined autopsy.

# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to
150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous
conversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses
and bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.  Digoxin
considered unfavorable in this patient.  In the MICU, pt was
started on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.  When
the patient was readmitted to the ICU on [**2194-1-30**], she was having
increased pauses up to 20 seconds.  Her amiodarone was stopped.


# Thrombocytopenia/Anemia: The patient was anemia and
thrombocytopenic throughout the admission thought to be
secondary to marrow infiltration of lymphoma. Was transfused
total of 3 units PLT (1 unit each on [**1-14**] and [**1-19**])
with a transfusion threshold of 10. Will continue to trend
platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.
Transfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].  Also, the
patient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total
of four units since [**2194-1-12**]).

# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having
hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to
fluid blosues of 250 cc.  ECHO demonstrated impaired LV
relaxation and given elevated WBC, there was concern for
distributive shock.  Once no longer fluid responsive, she was
started on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.  She was
again hypotension later in her admission thought to be secondary
to systemic vasodilation.  She was started on levophed but a
decision was then made to not escalate care.

# Infection: WBC elevated with multiple possible infectious
sources which could contribute to hypotension (ie, skin erosions
under breasts, course breath sounds with ?PNA).  Vanc and piptaz
started on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not
obtainable at this point.  CDiff repeated with toxin B. C Diff
neg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].  Now with GNR from skin swab.

# Hypernatremia: Noted to be periodically hypernatremic since
admission (Na 148-150), due to free water defecit. She has been
getting slow infusions of D5W as she has poor po intake and have
not been able to keep up her free water intake.

# Altered Mental Status: Increased lethargy compared to baseline
on admission most likely [**2-22**] metabolic encephalopathy due to
infection and acute renal failure, with slight improvement after
resolution of urosepsis. Head CT negative for acute process.
Thyroid studies show elevated TSH but this may be c/w sick
euthyroid syndrome.

# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient
developed labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for
hypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.  Diuresis with furosemide
gtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated
respiratory distress.  On [**2194-1-30**] she was on the floor and had a
witnessed aspiration event and needed 100% Hi Flow mask.  While
in the ICU her O2 was weaned but again aspirated and had
increasing O2 requirements.

# Acute renal failure: Pt noted to have Cr up to 1.7 on
admission from presumed baseline of 1.0, returned to baseline of
0.9. Likely was pre-renal due to dehydration and hypotension due
to sepsis.  Later in her hospital course, the patient was
hypotensive and her creatinine again began to rise thought
secondary to ATN.

# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg
IV daily (half home dose).  T3 low. TSH elevated.  Resumed home
dose 1/4.

# Anasarca: Pt has diffuse edema and large bilateral pleural
effusions likely third-spacing from malnutrition given low
albumin (2.8 on admission, then 2.2) and poor po intake.
Diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed
above.  Continue to monitor.

# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis
requiring pressor support. Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were
positive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin
and ceftazidime x10 days.  Repeat UCx [**2194-1-19**] grew out yeast,
which was not treated.  Another repeat UCx [**1-22**] final again grew
out yeast.

# Right Hip pain: Pain due to destruction of the right
acetabulum consistent with progressive lymphoma on CT scan.
There is dramatic medial displacement of the right femoral head
secondary to lack of remaining osseous support. Stable
destruction of the right posterior sacroiliac joint and
surrounding right sacral ala and iliac bone. The patient's pain
is being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.

# Bilateral pleural effusion: R>L, thought most likely due to
agressive hydration in the setting of sepsis and
hypoalbuminemia.  Was difficult to effect a significant diurese
in MICU due to development of hypotension in response to
furosemide. Appears slightly improved on CXR from [**2194-1-17**],
unchanged on [**1-20**] CXR.

# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no
interventions at this time. Likely with bone marrow infiltration
causing anemia and thrombocytopenia above, as pt with low retic
count and no evidence of hemolysis.  No further treatment per
oncology.

# Coagulopathy: Mild, likely due to nutritional deficiency.
Encourage PO intake and trend LFTs, coags.

IMPRESSION: There is no definite evidence for pneumonia, and
there is a slightly improved appearance to the pulmonary
vasculature compared to prior study suggesting improved fluid
status.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56F with decompensated EtOH cirrhosis w/ encephalopathy and
esophageal varices, admitted to ICU after being found down,
intubated.
.
# Altered mental status: Likely [**12-28**] hepatic encephalopathy, PA
lateral CXR negative, sputum cx. negative. Has had multiple
admissions for encephalopathy [**12-28**] med noncompliance, though pt.
and family report compliance with meds and 2-3 times daily BMs.
No leukocytosis or abd. pain, with minimal ascites, so unlikely
SBP. Sputum gram stain with G+ cocci, but cultures negative and
no e/o PNA on CXR. Tox screen negative on admission. CT head
negative.
- continued lactulose q6h with PRN lactulose enemas
- continued rifaximin, ursodiol at outpatient dose
- MVI/thiamine/folate
Pt.'s mental status cleared quickly and pt. was sent home on
increased lactulose/rifaxamin to prevent encephalopathy.
.
# Respiratory failure: intubated for airway protection, as
initially unresponsive,  MS quickly improved with lactulose, and
pt. was extubated.
.
# EtOH cirrhosis: Decompensated with encephalopathy, ascites,
and varices. Currently with minimal ascites. Last EGD [**4-28**], no
known h/o melena or BRBPR, guaiac negative on exam. MELD 16.
Thrombocytopenia within baseline. Tbili trended down during
admission.  Guaiacs negative during admission.
.
# Anemia: baseline wanders from 25-->36, hct stable during
admit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's temperature was 98.4.
Heart rate 76 to 79.  Blood pressure 90/50.  Respirations 15.
Sat 94 to 99% on 2 liters.  In general, well appearing and in
no acute distress.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  No scleral icterus.  Oropharynx is clear.
Conjunctiva were slightly pale.  No lymphadenopathy.  No
bruits.  JVP approximately 8 cm.  Chest rales at the right
base.  Cardiac regular.  S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  Abdomen was
benign, soft, nontender.  Good bowel sounds.  He had a
midline ventral hernia, which was soft. Liver was palpated 2
cm below the costal margin.  The patient was OB positive in
the Emergency Department.  Extremities revealed 1+ pedal
edema with venostasis changes bilaterally.  Skin examination
had no rashes.  The patient s alert and oriented times three
with a chronic left foot drop.

INITIAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit
31.4, which then dropped to 24.3, baseline is 41.  Platelets
138.  SMA 7 notable for a sodium of 136, K of 4.7, bicarb 24,
BUN 32, creatinine 0.5, glucose 158, INR 2.3.  Dilantin level
was 3.0.  ALT 35, AST 51, alkaline phosphatase 203.  Total
bilirubin .5, LDH 215, albumin 3.0.  Enzymes were cycled,
which were negative.  The patient's electrocardiogram
revealed normal sinus rhythm, PR prolongation at 206.  Left
axis deviation, inferior Qs, all of which were old.   There
were some new T wave flattening in V2 to V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient
was admitted with melena likely an upper gastrointestinal
bleed given history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, question of
enteric fistula.  Given history of hemochromatosis and early
cirrhosis, question of varices, given history of reflux
symptoms, question of esophagitis, gastritis.  The patient
was again admitted with gastrointestinal bleed and was typed
and crossed.  He was initially transfused 2 units for a
hematocrit of 24.  He had two peripheral intravenouses in
place.  INR was corrected with vitamin K 2 mg and 4 units of
fresh frozen platelets and hematocrit revealed a change from
24 up to 26 after 4 units.  INR corrected to 1.7.  The
patient  was also started on Protonix 40 intravenous b.i.d.
Aspirin and Coumadin  were held.  The patient underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the following morning, which
revealed grade 1 esophageal varices and mild gastritis
esophagitis as well as portal gastropathy.  There was no
active bleeding at any site.  The patient then underwent an
abdominal CT, which was negative for aortic enteric fistula.
On the following day the patient underwent a colonoscopy,
which was normal up until the ascending colon.  However, they
were not able to go all the way to the cecum and recommended
virtual colonoscopy in the future and the patient had then
underwent a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy with banding
times four to the esophageal varices.  The patient will need
a repeat banding procedure in ten days.  After the banding
the patient was started on Sucralfate 1 gram q.i.d. and was
continued on Protonix.  Again aspirin and Coumadin were held
throughout.  After 4 units hematocrit stabilized from 24 up
to 32 and remained stable at 32 upon discharge.

2.  Hypotension:  The patient was initially in the systolics
in the 90s likely hypovolemic in the setting of a
gastrointestinal bleed.  However, given the history of
cardiac disease the patient's enzymes were cycled times
three, which were negative.  He was resuscitated with fluid,
fresh frozen platelets and packed red cells and blood
pressure remained stable throughout.  After the
esophagogastroduodenoscopy the Atenolol was switched to
Nadolol given the history of cirrhosis and varices and
Zestril was held up until discharge due to low blood
pressures.

3.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient with a history of
myocardial infarction in [**2180**] and [**2182**] and is status post
stent of the percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
in [**2182**].  Enzymes were cycled, which were negative.  Aspirin
and Coumadin were held due to gastrointestinal bleed.  Beta
blocker and ace were initially held due to low blood
pressures.  Lipitor was held secondary to new cirrhosis.  The
patient was restarted on Nadolol upon discharge, however,
aspirin, Coumadin, Zestril and Lipitor were held prior to
discharge to be restarted by primary care physician at his or
her discretion.

4.  Deep venous thrombosis:  Patient with recurrent left
lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, but admitted with
gastrointestinal bleed.  INR 2.3, Coumadin was held due to
multiple procedures and held upon discharge.  The patient
will undergo repeat banding in ten days after which time the
patient may or may not resume anticoagulation per primary
care physician.

5.  Hemachromatosis:  The patient with hemachromatosis for
long standing, now with evidence of cirrhosis on examination.
The patient will continue with further phlebotomies as per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and may need further workup for cirrhosis.

6.  History of abdominal aortic aneurysm:  Patient ruled out
enteric fistula with negative abdominal CT.

7.  Seizure disorder:  The patient was given additional dose
of Dilantin 400 times one and then restarted on his regular
does of 300 and will continue on his regular dose.  No
further seizure activity.

8.  Diabetes:  The patient was initially held NPO diabetic
medications due to NPO status.  Was covered with a sliding
scale.  Sugars remained stable and can restart Glyburide upon
discharge.  Metformin held secondary to cirrhosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophageal varices s/p banding.
2.  Portal gastropathy.

Date of Birth:  [**2109-8-28**]        Sex:  F

Service:


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 73-year-old
female admitted to the CCU on [**2182-2-18**] with hyperkalemia and
bradycardia.  The patient had a past medical history
significant for hypertension, glaucoma, and breast cancer
treated with lumpectomy, XRT in [**2176**].  She was in her usual
state of health until [**12-2**] when she began to note shortness
of breath.  She saw her PCP and performed [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray,
which revealed a right upper lobe density.  This was followed
up with a CT scan, which revealed a lobulated mass of 2.3 cm
in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe and
bilateral lobe interstitial fibrosis.  Follow-up PET scan was
nondiagnostic.  The patient had a mediastinoscopy, which
showed no evidence of malignancy or lymph nodes.  Lung biopsy
was performed, which revealed pulmonary fibrosis.  Subsequent
spirometry revealed a mild restrictive defect.  The entire
picture was thought to represent UIP.

On [**2182-2-18**], she presented to the [**Hospital1 **]
[**First Name (Titles) 2142**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea times several days.  In the waiting room, she
developed presyncope.  She was urgently brought to the trauma
bay, there her heart rate was in the 30s with the EKG
revealing a junctional rhythm.  Her SBP was in the 80s.
Attempts made to place a temporary pacing wire but during the
procedure the patient suffered respiratory arrest.  She was
intubated and resuscitated, and a line was successfully
placed.  Subsequent labs revealed a potassium of 9.8.  The
patient was treated with calcium bicarb, insulin, and glucose
and admitted to CCU.

In the CCU, the patient was started on Levophed and dopamine
for hypotension.  Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to evaluate
her hypotension and revealed an SVR of 2473 with a cardiac
output of 2.2.  Two hours later, the cardiac output was 6.5
and SVR was 898 after pressors were weaned down.  Urgent TTE
revealed normal systolic function, no pericardial effusion.
Potassium dropped to 4.3 after 1 day.  The patient was
empirically treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl
for hypotension, which was thought possibly due to sepsis.
By hospital day 3, she was off pressors, her white blood
count was 16.1.  She was successfully extubated, and her
potassium remained normal.  By hospital day 4, she continued
to have mild respiratory distress despite being extubated.
She was thought to be in mild CHF.  She was diuresed.
Levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued for possible
pneumonia.  By hospital day 5, she developed worsening
respiratory distress, and the patient agreed to elective
intubation.  She was then transferred to the MICU for further
workup and care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Glaucoma.

Breast cancer.

UIP.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Verapamil.
2. Propranolol.
3. Tamoxifen.
4. Xalatan eye drops.
5. Betoptic eye drops.
6. Calcium carbonate.
7. Aspirin.
8. Folate.
9. Vitamin E.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the MICU, temperature
98.9 degrees, blood pressure 126/61, and pulse 108.  The
patient was sedated and intubated.  Her lungs revealed
diffuse crackles bilaterally.  Cardiac exam was within normal
limits.  Abdomen was benign.  Lower extremity revealed no
edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the MICU included
a white count of 21.9, hematocrit of 29.3, and  platelets of
85.

Chest x-ray on admission to MICU revealed persistent
bilateral upper lobe patchy opacities, may represent
interstitial edema plus aspiration.  Continued patchy
atelectasis within the left lower lobe and small left pleural
effusion.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with presumed diagnosis of
sepsis.  Subsequently, she developed a picture consistent
with ARDS and required multiple pressors.  After several days
in the CCU, she was on 3 different pressors and was unable to
maintain her blood pressure.  She was requiring increasing
ventilatory support.  A discussion was held with the family
who decided that the patient will be made DNI/DNR due to the
fact that CPR was likely to be unhelpful if the patient
arrested.  On [**2182-2-28**] at 03:15 p.m., the patient was
pronounced dead.  The family was at the bedside.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Expired.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  None.

FOLLOW UP PLAN:  None.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Septic shock.

Respiratory failure.

Hyperkalemia causing cardiopulmonary arrest.

Chief Complaint:
Reason for ICU admission: ROMI, coffee ground emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
HPI:
68 y.o. man with HTN presented to PCP for routine visit on day
of admission, c/o 2 months of worsening DOE and chest pressure
with exertion. He reports having a stress test 1 year ago which
was stopped after 3 minutes for hypertension (SBP in the 230s).
He had no symptoms and no ST wave changes. In addition, he
complains of severe heartburn (different than his chest
pressure) intermittently every few days x 3 months, along with
violent coughing fits which cause him to vomit dark brown
liquid. He denies frank blood in his emesis. The heartburn is
worse at night with lying flat. He denies NSAID use, but does
admit to drinking at least [**2-9**] drinks of burbon daily.
.
He was referred to the ED for concern of ACS. In the ED, he was
afebrile, HR 70s, BP 116/73m RR 16, and 97% RA. Hct was 41. His
trop was negative but ECG showed TWI in V1-V3 which were new. He
was given ASA 325, Lopressor, and started on nitroglycerin and
heparin gtt. Became hypotensive with nitro to SBP 80s, BP
responded to 2L NS. He then started to vomit brown colored,
guiac positive emesis. The heparin and nitro drips were stopped.
He was given IV protonix and Reglan. He was admitted to MICU for
further monitoring/ROMI.

normal (LVEF 70%) The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2142-12-6**], the findings are similar.
.
[**2143-11-25**].  EGD.
Severe esophagitis in the middle third of the esophagus and
lower third of the esophagus compatible with severe reflux
esophagitis (biopsy)
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy,
biopsy)
Erythema and congestion in the second part of the duodenum
compatible with duodenitis (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 2469**] is a 68 y.o. man with PMH significant
for HTN and alcohol abuse, admitted for DOE and chest pressure.
Patient was ruled out for MI, but developed coffee ground emesis
while on heparin drip.  EGD showed severe esophagitis and
gastritis.
.
Upper GI bleed.  Patient developed coffee-ground emesis in ED in
setting of chronic heartburn and alcohol abuse while on heparin
drip.   EGD showed severe esophagitis and gastritis, likely due
to chronic alcohol use.  Hct fell to 32 from 42 on admission,
but patient did not require transfusions.  He was sent home on
PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Gastric biopsies for H. pylori were pending at time of
discharge.
.
Chest pressure/ SOB.  Patient presented with CP and SOB on
exertion.  He has no history of CAD.  He had a stress test one
year ago which was terminated early due to hypertension.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.  He was initally started on a
heparin drip in the ED due to concern for unstable angina, but
this was stopped when patient developed coffee ground emesis.
His antihypertensives were intially held, but resumed on
hospital day 2.  A lipid panel was checked and his LDL was in
the 40s.  He was advised to get outpatient stress test and PFTs.
 Patient has a significant smoking history and CSR showed
hyperinflation, suggesting that his DOE may be pulmonary in
origin.
.
Alcohol abuse.  Patient has history of alcoholism and quit
drinking for 20 years and now drinks daily.  He denies history
of DTs or seizure.  He was tremulous and required a CIWA scale.
He was given thiamine, folate, and multivitamin during his
hospitalization.
.
Transaminitis.  Patient had mildly elevated LFTs that were
thought to be due to alcohol hepatitis.  Hepatitis serologies
were sent, but were pending at time of discharge.

etiology (?congenital hypoplasia), recurrent bronchitis in
winter, OSA, obesity, HTN who presented with 1 week of
productive cough, progresssive SOB, and over the past 2 days
weakness and fatigue to the point he was falling asleep at work.
He tried increasing his albuterol use but this did not help so
he came to the emergency room.

He had a CXR which was inconclusive, possible RML pneumonia.
Also be very tachycardic, EKG shows sinus tach. Got a CTA for
concern of PE-but no PE, but some increased interstitial
markings in RUL and RLL, more likely chronic process vs.
pneumonia. Tried to wean him down on 02, as soon as he would
fall asleep would desat. Right now, 40% venti mask and he is

[**2-12**] MRSA screen pending
[**2-12**] Urine culture and legionella- negative
[**2-12**] RSV screen negative

Imaging:
[**2-12**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2-12**] CXR:
SINGLE FRONTAL PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: As compared to prior
study there is minimal increase in right mid - lower lung
opacity . Right lower lobe pleural thickening is grossly stable.
Bullous changes denoted by relative lucency in the right upper
lobe are again noted and unchanged. Prominent right mediastinal
- paratracheal soft tissue remains unchanged. Left lung is
clear. Heart is not enlarged. The aortic contour is grossly
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Minimal interval increase in opacification of the
right mid -
lower lung is better evaluated on subsequent CT from same day.

[**2-12**] CTA Chest:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Right lung volume loss could be due to a congenital anomaly
or pulmonary infection early in life.
3. Persistent area of round atelectasis in the right lower lobe
with
increased size slightly since [**2166**].
4. New subpleural septal thickening in the left upper lobe and
medial basal left lower lobe, new since [**2166**] and suggestive of
an interstitial fibrosis.
5. Mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node.

Given the pulmonary interstitial findings and mildly enlarged
lymph node,
followup high-resolution CT is suggested, preferrably in 3
months if not
needed earlier.

[**2-14**] Transthoracic echocardiogram:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
function.
This constellation of findings is suggestive of a primary
pulmonary process, e.g., pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 99.5 P109 BP101/56 R24 79% on RA
on presentation, 100% on NRB. Labs notable for WBC of 5, HCT
34.5, sodium of 131 and creatinine of 1.0. Patient was given
ceftriaxone and azithromycin, nebs, and methylprednisone.  He
had a CXR which was possibly suggestive of RML pneumonia, and a
CTA that showed no signs of PE but did reveal some increased
interstitial markings in the RUL and RLL, more consistent with a
chronic process vs. pneumonia. the patient was admitted to the
ICU for monitoring on [**2-12**]. He had in past refused CPAP for his
OSA but accepted it and reported he had an unusually restful
night. He was transferred to the medicine floor on [**2-13**].

#  Hypoxia: His increased cough and the CT and chest Xray
imaging were most consistent with a right middle lobe pneumonia
with underlying chronic pneumonic process, and he will need
another high-resolution chest CT in 3 months to evaluate
progression of these findings. In the ICU, he continued
antibiotic treatment for CAP. He did not receive further
steroids. He had an Echo that showed RV enlargement, free wall
hypokinesis & moderate elevation of PASP. Although these
findings were consistent with possible pulmonary embolism, he
had a CTA on admission that was negative for PE. Pulmonary was
consulted and felt his right heart findings could be related to
his underlying known chronic lung disease and sleep apnea rather
than PE. After discussion with his PCP and pulmonologist, he was
discharged to have a repeat sleep study performed and follow-up
TTE in 1 month.  Patient was encouraged to start using home
CPAP.

# Hyponatremia: He was noted to be mildly hyponatremic at
admission, possibly due to salt-wasting from his HCTZ use. This
mild hyponatremia resolved with a liter of normal saline.

# Obstructive sleep apnea: He is now agreeable to trialing CPAP.
He was told he should have an outpatient sleep study as above.

# Normocytic Anemia: His hematocrit was slightly lower than
recent baseline, and iron studies were consistent with chronic
inflammation.  This will be further worked up as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with shortness of breath and fatigue.
You were briefly in the intensive care unit for close monitoring
and your breathing improved with antibiotics and steroids.  You
were found to have pneumonia and are being treated with
antibiotics.  You had an echocardiogram of your heart that
showed some strain on the right side of your heart, and this is
likely due to your lung disease.  Please follow-up with your PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] and your pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as below.  You have
also been scheduled to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in sleep medicine to
discuss your sleep apnea.

The following changes were made to your medications:
Started levofloxacin, an antibiotic, once daily.  You should
take this for 4 more days.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with your PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**], on [**2-21**] at 4:20pm.  You
should have another echocardiogram done in 1 month to evaluate
your heart function.

You have an appointment to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], a sleep physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
[**2-22**] at 8 AM, [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building [**Location (un) **] to discuss your
sleep apnea. You should be fitted for a CPAP machine at home to
treat your obstructive sleep apnea.  If you need to reschedule,
you can call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].

Please follow-up with Pulmonary (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**3-22**] at
8:45 AM on the [**Location (un) 436**] of the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building, [**Location (un) 2476**].  If an earlier appointment is available, they will contact
you.  If you need to reschedule your appointment, please call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].

A CT of the chest showed subpleural septal thickening in the
left upper and medial basal lower lobes, new since [**2166**], and a
mildly enlarged 13-mm prevascular lymph node. Given these
findings, you should have a second high-resolution CT in the
next 3 months to determine whether these changes resolve on
their own.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 54M with hx of ETOH abuse, HCV, presenting
with AF with RVR, Chest Pain in the setting of ETOH
intoxication.
.
#: AF with RVR: Pt was in AF with RVR at presentation, which was
a new finding from prior EKGs. EKG showed no evidence of
ischemia. Pt was started on dilt gtt in ED and was transitioned
to PO metoprolol after arriving the ICU. HR was stable in 90s at
rest. Patient left AMA without waiting to receive his
prescriptions or cardiology follow-up. He was instructed to
return to the ED for palpitations, chest pain, SOB or any other
symptoms. He was instructed to follow up with his PCP.
.
# ETOH Intoxication: Pt presented with ETOH level of 412 and was
intoxicated. Lactate elevated but quickly trended down. He
received banana bag, and PO folate and thiamine. Electrolytes
were normal. Patient was monitored on CIWA scale in the ICU and
received Valium prn. SW was consulted. However, patient left
AMA. He stated he planned to take his home dose Campral and
continue attending AA meetings. He lives in a recovery home and
was instructed to have EMS notified if he experiences shaking,
confusion or any other symptoms.
.
#. Chest pain:
Pt presented with atypical chest pain in the setting of
intoxication that was reproducible on palpation. He denies
trauma but had been lifting heavy boxes recently. Pt evaluated
by Cards while in ED who felt that pain was non-cardiac. ASA
325mg and Nitroglycerin x1. One set of CE was significant for
elevated CK but normal troponin. DDx includes muscluoskeletal,
no evidence of PNA or ACS. PE unlikely given reproducibility.
.
# Anemia: Hct 30 on arrival. Near prior baseline. No evidence of
GI Bleed, no known prior hx of varies.
.
# HCV: Currently not receiving treatment. [**Hospital6 1597**],
records confirmed that Hep C antibody was confirmed to be
positive [**2143-6-2**]. HCV genotype was type IB, and RNA viral load
was
996,000 copies at that time.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1865**]
Chief Complaint:
 Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
* interview conducted with the aid of Ms. [**Known lastname 1862**] daughter
.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 y/o F with
history of nephrotic CRI, renal artery stenosis, and CHF, who
presented with hypertensive emergency and heart failure. The
patient reports that she was in her usual state of health until
3 days prior to admission. At that time, her BP was 220 systolic
@ home and she noticed mild SOB. On the night prior to
admission, she developed increasing SOB. Per the patient's
daughter, she had been taking her medications as prescribed. She
denies chest pain throughout this time. She was brought in by
daughter to [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation and was found to have BP 202/40
with a K of 5.9. She was treated with kayexalate 30, lasix 40
IV, clonidine 0.3 mg PO X 1, and levoflox 750 mg IV x 1.
.
The patient was initially admitted to the floor, where she was
found to have the following vitals: 98.3 226/68 68 90% 5LNC (mid
80s on 2LNC), 96% on face tent, RR > 40. As she was acutely
dyspneic and in acute failure, she was given 100mg IV lasix and
Diuril (on the advice of Renal consultants), w/ good effect->
UOP 350cc in ~1hour. She did not receive any nitrates or
morphine at the time. On MICU evaluation was 99% on shovel mask,
but still RR>40. Appeared comfortable, JVP ~9 cm. At that time,
she denied HA, visual changes, CP, urinary changes, no abd pain,
N/V/D. In the MICU, she was aggressively diuresed and placed on
her usual blood pressure regimen. Overnight [**Date range (1) 1873**], she did
not receive all of her blood pressures meds as her BPs were in
the 110s/120s overnight. She did receive all doses of clonidine
and hydralazine on [**5-9**].
.
Her daughter tells me that her edema is less than usual, but
that her right leg is chronically larger than the left. She has
been using several pillows to sleep at home. She denies PND. She
is not on supplemental O2 at home. Generally BP at home is 170s
(per PCP 160s in office at baseline).
.
Pt was diagnosed with w/ RLL PNA by her PCP and tx [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/
levofloxacin X 10 days about 4 weeks ago. Since that time, the
daughter has been living with the pt X 3 weeks. Her cough has
persisted per the daughter, but the patient did improve greatly
following antibiotics.
.
At the present time, the patient says she is comfortable. She
denies chest pain. She continues to make adequate urine.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
[**2194-5-8**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate congestive heart failure,
worse since the exam of one month ago.
.
[**2194-5-8**] ECHO: TTE Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60%).
.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal mitral
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic.
.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2193-9-19**], borderline mitral stenosis is now evident.
The mitral regurgitation, which is almost certainly
underestimated on this study, is probably increased.
.
[**2194-5-11**] CXR TWO VIEWS: Comparison with the previous study done
[**2194-5-9**]. There is interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary
edema. The mild pulmonary vascular congestion persists. Streaky
density at the lung bases is consistent with subsegmental
atelectasis. There is a moderate right pleural effusion and
small left pleural effusion. An underlying right basilar
consolidation cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old female with probable endstage
renal failure not on HD, who presented with hypertensive
emergency and congestive heart failure.  She was admitted to the
medical floor but immediately was sent to the MICU for
respiratory distress. There she was agressively diuresed and
then returned to the medical floor.
.
* Hypertensive Emergency: Her HTN is likely secondary to her
ESRD.  The elevated blood pressures caused flash pulmonary edema
and congestive heart failure.  She was given blood pressure
medications to help control her BP within the range of 130-160
as she probably is dependent on some hypertension for perfusion.
 Her baseline BP is reportedly 160 at home.  Ultimately she was
placed on clonidine 0.2 mg TID, hydralazine 100mg TID, norvasc
10mg qday, metoprolol 12.5mg TID, lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
* ? SVT: During her initally presentation, she did have some
runs of SVT noted on telemetry.  Once she was diuresed no
further episodes were noted.  She was continued on metoprolol
12.5 mg TID for given episodes of ? SVT.
.
* Congestive Heart Failure: Likely from worsening renal failure
and hypertensive urgency. She was agressively diuresed in the
MICU with IV furosemide overnight and then with PO furosemide on
the medical floor. She was also continued on hydralazine for
afterload reduction.
.
* Renal Failure: A renal consult was obtained.  They felt that
there was no acute needs for dialysis at present although they
have been discussing starting HD with the patient and her family
for a while now.  This discussion was continued throughout the
admission and the patient and her family were resistent to
starting.  They agreed to meet with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] in the next two
weeks to discuss getting a tunnelled cath and starting HD.
Throughout admission, her electrolytes were monitored closely as
she had boughts of hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and acidosis.
 These were controlled with standard measures.
.
* Hyperkalemia: Received Kayexalate in ED. Usually takes
kayexalate twice a week as outpatient, so this was restarted as
an inpatient.
.
* Anemia: Baseline Hct appears to be 29-33 and now 25. Iron 45,
ferritin 149, TIBC 269 in [**3-5**]. Per renal recommendation, she
was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**2194-5-12**] without complications.
.
* Bacteremia: WBC count 10 on admission and down to 6.4 today.
Has been afebrile but blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles with
staph coag negative- likely contaminant. Before speciation
returned, she was treated with vancomycin dosed by level. Once
it was found to be coag negative staph, the vancomycin was
discontinued. All subsequent surveillence cultures were
negative.
.
* Code status: Full - discussed w/ patient's daughter.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 86F with h/o colon cancer, ESRD on
hemodialysis, diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and prior
cephalic vein thrombosis who presented to the ED on [**8-15**] with
dyspnea.

The patient's dialysis catheter became dislodged [**8-12**].
Consequently she missed her normal dialysis session [**8-13**]. On
[**8-14**] she had a new tunneled catheter placed, but was not
dialyzed. The afternoon of [**8-14**] her daughter noticed that the
patient seemed increasingly dyspneic and was hypertensive to
200's. She was given hydralazine and clonidine and the BP
improved to 160's. She called her daughter ~3am on [**8-15**] due to
worsening dyspnea. The patient denies any accompanying headache,
vision changes, chest discomfort, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting, cough, weakness or loss of sensation. EMS was called,
and she was given CPAP with some relief of her dyspnea. Per her
daughter, similar symptoms have occurred 3 times in the past.

In the ED her vitals were BP 258/61 RR 28 O2 100% on CPAP, 89%
on room air (temperature was not recorded). She was started on a
nitroglycerin drip, and given calcium and bicarbonate for a
potassium of 7.1. She was weaned off NIPPV, with O2 saturation
of 97% on 3L NC. She was subsequently transferred to the ICU for
further monitoring and dialysis.

Past Medical History:
1) Hypertension
2) Stage V chronic kidney disease, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**].
3) Diastolic CHF (EF 60% on TTE in [**5-3**]), likely volume related
in the setting of her renal disease.
4) Rheumatic fever, with the following valvular abnormalities:
Mild aortic stenosis, moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
stenosis, mild to moderate MR, mild TR.
5) Severe PA systolic hypertension
6) Renal artery stenosis:  MRI [**2185**] atrophic R kidney, moderate
stenosis of R renal artery, L renal artery normal.
7) Peripheral vascular disease:  Has claudication.

FINDINGS:  AP view of the chest on upright position.  The
cardiac silhouette cannot be evaluated on this AP view.  The
right-sided central venous catheter is unchanged.  The left
costophrenic angle is blunted consistent with pleural effusions.
 Left lung base atelectasis are noted.  There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. There is a right lung base opacity obscuring the
right-side cardiac border which may represent right middle lobe
atelectasis vs. pneumonia. Pprominence of the pulmonary
vasculature is noted, consistent with mild CHF. The osseous
structures are unchanged.
  IMPRESSION:
1.  Right middle lobe atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
2.  Mild CHF with small left- sided pleural effusion.

[**8-15**] EKG
Sinus bradycardia at 56bpm, left axis, old RBBB, peaked T's that
are new compared to [**2194-6-24**] EKG. Inverted T in V3 on [**6-2**] EKG
has flipped to positive. No signs of acute ischemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea - The patient's dyspnea was thought to be secondary
from volume overload, occuring in the context of ESRD and a
missed hemodialysis session, as well as hypertension leading to
flash pulmonary edema. Her dyspnea following hemodialysis.

2. Hypertension - The patient's hypertension is also likely
related to volume overload. Her blood pressures improved
following dialysis and resumption of her home course of toprol,
clonidine, amlodipine, and hydralazine.

3. Hyperkalemia - The patient's potassium normalized following
dialysis.

4. ESRD - Renal following, on dialysis MWF.

5. FEN - Continue sevelemer, nephrocaps.

CXR [**2198-7-17**]:
Semi-upright portable AP view of the chest obtained.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with diffuse ground-glass
haziness throughout the lungs compatible with pulmonary edema.
The right hemidiaphragm remains somewhat elevated and overall
low lung volumes are noted which somewhat limit the evaluation.
There are no large pleural effusions and no sign of
pneumothorax. Hilar engorgement is compatible with congestive
heart failure.  Bony structures appear intact.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema.

LHC [**2198-7-23**]:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe three vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal
without any
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting lesions. The stent in
the
proximal LAD had diffuse 60% in-stent restenosis. There was 80%
stenosis
throuhgout the proximal LCX, with a 60-70% stenosis at the
origin of the
OMB. The RCA had a 100% proximal stenosis with prominent
left-to-right
collaterals.
2) Resting hemodynamics showed elevated right and left-sided
filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and an LVEDP of 27 mmHg. The
peak
gradient over the aortic valve was 14 mmHg. Using the Gorlin
equation,
the [**Location (un) 109**] was calculated to be 1.1 cm2, indicating moderate aortic

stenosis.
3) Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
4. Needs diuresis prior to cardioversion.
5. Consideration for AVR-CABG.

LENI [**2198-7-24**]: negative for DVT

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent the usual preoperative work-up.  Dental
examined the patient and recommended extraction of one tooth.
The patient refused.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2198-7-25**] where
the patient underwent AVR (tissue), CABG x 3, resection of left
atrial appendage with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He does have a history of heart failure with an EF of 30% and
initially required multiple inotropes and vasopressors.  He
remained intubated due to pulmonary congestion, which improved
with diuresis.  Rapid a-fib developed and amiodarone drip was
initiated.  This was discontinued when rate was controlled.  He
failed a trial of Precedex.  He self-extubated and was
re-intubated without incident.  He developed a leukocytosis and
was started on cipro for a positive urinalysis.  There was no
growth on culture, and cipro was discontinued.  Tube feeds were
started on POD 3.  He was extubated on POD 4.  By this time, all
vasoactive drips had been weaned.  Coumadin was resumed for
chronic a-fib.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  Beta-blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the pre-operative weight.
ACE Inhibitor was not initiated due to a rise in Creatinine,
which would start to trend down prior to discharge.  The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #10
the patient was ambulating freely, and pain was controlled with
oral analgesics. Due to upper and lower pole serosanguinous
sternal drainage, Mr.[**Known lastname 1884**] was placed on prophylactic
antibiotics x 1 week per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was discharged  to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
76yo F with PAF s/p recent TEE-DCCV on [**4-21**], HTN, admitted with
hypoxic respiratory failure.  She was recently hospitalized from
[**Date range (1) 1919**] for a supratherapeutic INR of 16.  She was in AF with
a ventricular rate of 110s-140s, asymptomatic.  Medical
management of her AF was initially tried.  She was maintained on
her atenolol and propafenone, and diltiazem was added.  The
decision was then made to pursue cardioversion instead.
TEE-DCCV was performed on [**2112-4-21**].  She was in sinus rhythm
after the procedure and had a HR in the 50s on atenolol and
propafenone upon discharge.  The diltiazem had been discontinued
secondary to bradycardia post-procedure.  She was also
discharged on Coumadin 1mg qhs.  Her family states her symptoms
began just prior to discharge, when she began to feel short of
breath and fatigued.  Her symptoms progressively worsened at
home.  She was seen in [**Company 191**] the next morning and was found to
have O2 sats in the 80s, so she was sent to the ED.
.
In the ED, her T was 100.6, HR 70s in NSR, and she was 84% on
4L.  Her CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions and vascular
engorgement, and her INR was 9.  She received a Combivent neb,
Lasix 20mg IV, levofloxacin 500mg IV, and vitamin K 5mg SC.  She
was intubated for hypoxia.  Repeat CXR showed improvement in
pulmonary edema after Lasix.  She was admitted to the CCU for
further management of hypoxia due to possible CHF.

EKG: NSR at 72, normal axis and intervals, T wave flattening in
aVL, peaked Ts on V3-V6, no ST segment changes
.
CXR: continued moderate-to-severe pulmonary interstitial edema
with bilateral pleural effusions, no evidence of pneumothorax
.
TEE ([**4-21**]): The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular cavity size, and systolic function are
normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch and
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Stress echo ([**9-25**]): Good functional exercise capacity. No ECG or
2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved
workload. Mildly blunted hemodynamic response to exercise. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Limited study. Target HR not achieved.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Dyspnea: Her shortness of breath and respiratory failure were
thought secondary to  pulmonary edema.  The pulmonary edema
likely followed an indolent course, with her rapid atrial
fibrillation and diastolic dysfunction causing progressive
volume overload.  Her acute exacerbation was likely due to
post-cardioversion pulmonary edema.  She initially had a
low-grade fever, but pneumonia was thought less likely, and her
chest x-ray was without infiltrate.  She had normal cardiac
enzymes, so ischemia was not a contributing factor.  She was
maintained on a beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor.  After
aggressive diuresis, she was weaned off mechanical ventilation
quickly.  Diuresis was continued with prn IV Lasix, and she had
resolution of her dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: She was in sinus rhythm on admission, and
was initially maintained on propafenone and metoprolol.  On [**4-23**],
she converted to atrial fibrillation and had a rapid ventricular
response in the 140s.  She underwent DC cardioversion, after
which she became hypotensive and bradycardic, requiring
transient treatment with dopamine.  She was continued on
propafenone after the DCCV.  On the morning of [**4-26**], she
converted into atrial fibrillation again, with rates of 140s.
She had a normal blood pressure and some mild palpitations.  She
was initially loaded with po amiodarone, with slowing of her
heart rates to the 100s to 110s.  When her heart rate began to
trend up again, she was loaded with IV amiodarone and started on
a drip.  Her rates remained in the 100s to 110s.  She was
transitioned to po amiodarone on the night of [**4-26**].  She
experienced nausea and vomiting on po amiodarone.  She underwent
another cardioversion on [**4-29**] but reverted back to atrial
fibrillation the next day.  She was continued on amiodarone but
remained in atrial fibrillation.  She went into rapid
ventricular response in the 150s on [**5-1**], requiring IV diltiazem
to bring her rate down.  She was started on po diltiazem, which
was quickly titrated up with her heart rate decreasing to the
80s.  The diltiazem was stopped the morning of [**5-3**], just before
she underwent another cardioversion.  She remained in sinus
rhythm for the rest of her stay.  She was discharged on
amiodarone 200mg po three times daily, with a follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].  Anticoagulation as below.
.
# Elevated INR:  INR went from 4 on [**4-21**] to 9 on [**4-22**] with only
1 mg of Coumadin.  Last admission was for INR of 16 on Coumadin
4mg qhs.  Received 5mg vitamin K SC in the ED.  Repeat coags on
the floor showed INR of 11, would have expected some decline
with SC vitamin K.  Her INR decreased to 4.5 with FFP.  Her INR
then decreased to normal.  Hematology was consulted and felt she
could potentially have a partial clotting factor deficiency
causing her severe sensitivity to Coumadin.  Her Coumadin was
held throughout most of her stay, and she was maintained on IV
heparin.  Coumadin was restarted at 0.5mg on [**5-3**] after her
cardioversion.  Her INR remained subtherapeutic after 2 doses.
She was discharged on Coumadin 0.5mg qhs with a Lovenox bridge,
with an INR check 4 days after discharge.  She is to follow up
with her PCP to consider Hematology follow up.

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement on [**2157-2-1**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 1929**] [**Known lastname 1930**] is a very nice 85 year-old woman with a
history of cholecystectomy and ampullar stenosis who presents
with RUQ abdominal pain. She states her pain started 2 days
prior to admission, was constant and radiated towards the back.
She had nausea, vomit, malaise.  Denies fever, chills, changes
in her bowel movements, hematochezia or melena.  Unable able to
tolerate oral intake.

Presenting vitals were T 101.5, HR 68, BP 152/76, RR 16, SpO2
95% RA.  In ED, Unasyn 3gm given and a right IJ central line was
placed. She underwent ERCP that showed 1-cm stone in the common
bile duct. Patient became hypoxic from the conscious sedation,
so the stone was not removed to expedite the procedure. A
plastic biliary stent was successfully placed.  Post-ERCP, she
was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of cholangitis.

ICU course:  In the ICU, the patient was continued on Zosyn, her
RUQ pain significantly improved, and she began to tolerate
fluids.  On [**2-3**], she developed shortness of breath that
improved with administration of furosemide.  Nebulizer
treatments also given.  At time of transfer to floor, O2 sat was
95% on 2L nasal canula.  Lisinopril restarted, but Atenolol and
Nifedipine held for concern of lower heart rate.

She was transferred to the floor and felt improvement in her
abdominal pain.  Denied shortness of breath, chest pain.

ERCP [**2157-2-1**]:
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Evidence of a previous wide open sphincterotomy
was noted in the major papilla. Pus was noted at the ampulla.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected
resulting in complete opacification.

Biliary Tree: A single 15 mm stone that was causing partial
obstruction was seen at the lower third of the common bile duct.
The bile duct was dilated to 15 mm. The rest of the biliary tree
was normal. Detailed cholangiogram was not obtained due to
suspicion of cholangitis.
Procedures: A 5cm by 10FR Double pig-tail biliary stent was
placed successfully.

Impression: S/P sphincterotomy - this was widely patent.
Pus noted at the ampulla.
Stone at the lower third of the common bile duct, dilation of
bile duct to 15 mm, other normal biliary tree.
A double pig-tail stent was placed in the bile duct.

Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

TTE [**2-8**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year-old woman presents with cholangitis [**12-21**]
choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP with biliary stent placement.
Gallstone was not removed because of the patient's tenous
condition.  The plan will be to repeat the ERCP in one month to
remove the stone.  Patient was also with bacteremia with E. Coli
and Enterococcus likely [**12-21**] biliary source.  Patient initially
on Zosyn, but because of thrombocytopenia was changed over to
Vanco and Cipro.  This was finally changed to ampicillin when
susceptibilities resulted.

# Cholangitis: RUQ pain, fever, leukocytosis with bandemia, AST
979, ALT 723, AP 120, TB 3.5 and direct of 2.4. ERCP was
performed and a double pigtail plastic stent was placed. Her
hemodynamics remained stable. Blood cultures were positive for
gram negative rods, and she was treated with IV Zosyn.
Hepatitis serologies demonstrated previous hepatitis A exposure.
 She developed bacteremia (see below) and will continue
antibiotics until [**2-16**].  She will need ERCP follow up in 1 month
for repeat ERCP and stent placement.

# E. Coli and Enterococcus bacteremia both susceptible to
Ampicillin.  Pt initially on Zosyn, then changed to Vanco and
Ciprofloxacin given thrombocytopenia.  ID was consulted and did
not recommend cardiac imaging given that the likely source was
the biliary tree and surveillance cultures were negative.  She
was converted to ampicillin and should continue a 14 day course
since last negative culture ([**Date range (3) 1933**]).

# Shortness of breath likely [**12-21**] fluid overload: Patient was
intermittently tachypneic and wheezing and was treated with
albuterol nebs and lasix with improvement.  ECHO ordered to
evaluate for systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  She was found
to have restrictive filling pressures and elevated [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**].
 She will be discharged on lasix 10mg daily until she sees her
PMD.  She will need cardiology follow up given her disease.

# Thrombocytopenia: PLTs decreased to 83 ([**2-3**]) from 182 on
admission. Pt not on heparin, thought to be [**12-21**] sepsis at
admission. Hemolysis labs not concerning for DIC, and less
likely thought to be due to ITP or TTP. After discontinuation of
Zosyn, the platelets increased and remained stable. On
discharge, her platelets were 252.

# Hypertension: Lisinopril restarted in ICU. Atenolol and
Nifedipine restarted on the floor.  Blood pressures were well
controlled on the floor.

# GERD: Pantoprazole was started.

# Parkinson's disease: Continued Carbidopa-Levodopa

# Diverticulosis: Stable.  Guaiac negative stools.

on her gown. It was felt likely that she had an aspiration event
with low grade temp  However, she was still moving all four
extremities and responding appropriately to questions though
mildly sedated prior to transfer to the floor.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt was minimally responsive to sternal
rub and did not withdraw to focal stimuli.  She was notably
tachypneic and eyes were deviated to right side.  She was able
to track to left with stimuli and would intermittently open eyes
to command.   Pt had an ABG 7.4/36/92 with lactate of 3.5 and
CXR showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  Due to concern for
acute intracranial hemmorrhage, she was taken down for a stat CT
head.  On return to the floor, pt was given narcan without any
significant change in mental status.  Neuro was consulted for
possible acute stroke and within a few minutes, she became more
responsive, opening eyes spontaneously. By the time neuro came
to bedside, pt was able to verbalize her name and was noted to
be using the right arm and had left sided deficit.  A CODE
stroke was called and pt was taken for urgent CTA head which did
not show any vessel obstruction and TPA was felt unlikely to be
helpful.  Perfusion images confirmed right temporal
hypoperfusion consistent with clinical exam and likely right MCA
infarct.  ICU consult was initiated and pt's guardian was
notified.  Pt was given Vanc/Cefepime and Aspirin 300mg PR while
awaiting ICU transfer.  She was lying flat per neuro recs and
was noted to be spitting up bilious emesis.  Head of bed was
elevated and pt was suctionned prior to transferred to the ICU
for closer monitoring of airway and management of acute
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 y/o F with PMhx of Developmental Delay, COPD, HL, HTN and
Mirizzi syndrome who presented on [**10-17**] for elective ERCP. Pt
was noted to have emesis on her gown in the post procedure suite
with diffuse wheezes and low grade temp. It was thought likely
that she had an aspiration event and when she was arrived on the
floor, she had a profoundly depressed mental status, tachypnea
and fever to 101.9.  Further stat work up revealed evidence of
aspiration PNA, leukocytosis and elevated lactate.  Initial head
imaging was unrevealing. However, she became more alert and was
noted to have an acute left sided deficit. CODE STROKE was
called and CTA/perfusion images confirmed right sided
hypoperfusion likely consistent with right MCA stroke.  Neuro
felt there was no indication for TPA given patent intracranial
vessels and on return to the floor, pt was noted to have bilious
secretions that she was having difficulty clearing.  She was
transferred to the ICU for airway monitoring overnight. Pt was
called out to the floor when she was able to cough and spit up
secretions.  She was noted to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status, sometimes will respond to commands and other times will
not.  BP was allowed to autoregulate for the first 72 hrs post
event and pt was continued on Aspirin 300mg daily.  She was
noted to have recovery of left arm function and was answering
yes/no to questions.

She was seen by PT/OT who recommended ongoing therapy upon
return to NH.
After discussion with HCP/guardian, decision was made to avoid
follow up MRI as it was not likely to change care plan and pt
was unlikely to tolerate the procedure.  Echo was performed to
rule out cardioembolic source which did not show any thrombus.
Lipid panel showed LDL in the 93, and Hgb A1c 9.4.  She was
hyperglycemic during the hospitalization, and she was started on
Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
.
Aspiration PNA: Pt was noted to have aspiration event s/p
procedure and was monitored in the ICU for 24hrs given concern
for her ability to protect airway .  Leukocytosis, lactate and
fevers resolved after initiation of Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
Respiratory status improved and pt had a PICC placed and she
completed a course of antibiotics.

Upper Extremity DVT- Patient was subsequently developed a DVT
associated with the PICC line. The PICC line was discontinued
and she was started on Lovenox.  Once a PEG tube was placed, she
was started on Warfarin for a goal INR of [**2-6**].  Please follow
INR closely and titrate prn.  She received her first dose of
Warfarin 5 mg on [**11-2**].

Aspiration - Pt was seen by speach/swallow on multiple
occasions, which she grossly failed with aspiration.  She was
kept strictly NPO, and she was maintained with IV medications
and hydration.  A dobhoff was placed for initiation of tube
feeds, while waiting to see if she would regain her swallow
function.  It is/was hoped that her swallow function would
improve, especially considering her significant recovery in her
left arm movement, however, she did not show significant
improvement on serial exams.  In discussion with Speech and
Swallow, however, there is some hope that she may recover her
swallow on a long term basis, and Swallow therapy may help with
this recovery.  They suggested an approximate 50% chance of
recovery to the point of safe oral intake in the long-term.
.
Diabetes-Pt with uncontrolled hyperglycemia after the initiation
of tube feeds. Her lantus and insulin sliding scales were
agressively increased. She is being discharged on 70 units of
lantus, and a sliding scale.
.
Mirizzi Syndrome s/p ERCP: Pt with abnormal biliary anatomy who
underwent stent and sphincteroplastyon [**10-17**] for recurrent abd
pain. She was noted to have an acute rise in transaminases post
procedure and these trended down with normal Tbili.  Pt was
followed by ERCP team while in house.
.
Developmental Delay: baseline confirmed with her guardian/mother
and nursing home.
.
HTN: held BP meds to allow autoregulation s/p stroke. She was
subsequently treated with IV metoprolol, clonidine patch, and IV
lasix, with benefit. After obtaining access via PEG, a blood
pressure medication regimen via PEG was begun. I expect that she
will benefit from further titration of medications as an
outpatient.  Please note that she was also started on
Lisinopril; please follow up lytes in 1 week to ensure she
tolerates.
.
Hyperlipidemia: Patient's simvastatin was held while patient was
NPO. This was resumed after obtaining access via PEG. This
medication dose was increased to 40 mg for goal LDL <70
considering diabetes and stroke.  Please follow up LFT's to
ensure tolerating, and lipid profile to ensure she meets her
targets.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F w/ DM2, HTN, PA HTN p/w SOB and LE edema x1 week, now
with severe anemia
(hct of 17 noted by her PCP) thought to be secondary to UGIB,
hemodynamically stable s/p 6 Units of bld w/ increase of hct to
30. serial hcts q 6 hrs remained stable at 30.

Pt had EGD in ED ([**2132-9-5**]) which revealed granularity,
friability and erythema in the stomach body, fundus and antrum
compatible with acute gastritis (biopsy obtained). Erythema in
the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis. Ulcer in the
distal bulb. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the
duodenum.

Echo:([**2132-8-23**])
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2128-8-18**], there has been no significant change.

1. GIB with increased BUN, likely UGIB, however LGIB initially
considered as well.
Pt had 2 large bore IV's placed.  NG lavage was positive as well
as stool guiacs. EGD as above. No active bleed noted however
ulcer and gastritis likely source of anemia. Ulcer thought to be
secondary to NSAID use vs H. pylori.  Will treat for H.Pylori if
indicated. Pt will follow up with GI. ASA was held secondary to
bleed.  Losartan was initially held, then restarted at half
normal dose. NSAIDs were avoided. Initially given IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
which was then changed to po. Colonoscopy performed was reported
to be normal.

2. Cardiac. EKG changes (NSR at 84, Nl axis and intervals, TWI
III, TWI V1-V4). Pt was ruled out for MI with three sets of neg
cardiac enzymes. She denied CP. ECG changes likely secondary to
demand ischemia from severe anemia. She was initially monitored
on tele with no events. An echo done on [**2132-8-23**], as above
(LVEF>55%). SOB most likely due to discontinuation of lasix for
one week in setting of diastolic CHF. Treated with 40 of lasix
IV (held off on diuresis intially secondary to concern for GI
bld).

3. Resp. CXR done on [**2132-9-5**] without overt evidence of CHF or
pneumonia. Findings suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.
 She required O2 supplementation during her stay and was noted
to have RA sats in the 80's with ambulation likely secondary to
PA HTN. She was sent home on supplemental O2. A Repeat cxr was
suggestive of pulm congestion. Lasix given as above.

4. DM2. Initially bld sugars controlled with RISS, oral
hyperglycemics were restarted prior to discharge.

5. Anemia secondary to gastritis and PUD, as well as Fe/Vit B12
def. She was transfused a total of 6 Units of PRBC's and her hct
was monitored q 6 hrs. She was started on Vit B12
supplementation. She was continued on Niferex.

C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA W/FLEX & EXT 4 VIEWS  [**2134-3-8**] 3:46 PM
IMPRESSION: Limited evaluation of the c-spine, with limited
range of motion. No listhesis seen on these views.
.
MR L SPINE SCAN  [**2134-2-27**] 10:09 PM
IMPRESSION:
Spinal stenosis noted at the level of L3-4 and L4-5 as discussed
above.

IMPRESSION:
1. Thickening and ill-definition of the right brachial plexus
just lateral to the superior ribs and inferior to the
subscapularis muscle immediately below the coracoid process,
likely secondary to trauma. No mass or hematoma impinging upon
the nerves within the axilla or medially. The appearance of the
nerves as they course by the proximal humeral shaft fracture is
not well evaluated on this study as it is too peripheral.
2. Humeral shaft fracture and hemorrhage within the subcoracoid
bursa not completely evaluated on this study.
3. Cervical spine disc degeneration seen on cervical spine MR.

.
HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT  [**2134-2-16**] 5:46 PM
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT HAND: There is diffuse osseous
demineralization. There are degenerative changes with no
definite fracture. Joint spaces are preserved.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT WRIST: Alignment is normal. No
fractures are identified. There are multiple rounded calcific
bodies in the dorsal soft tissues that do not appear to be
fracture fragments.
THREE VIEWS OF THE RIGHT ELBOW: Alignment is normal. No
fractures are identified. There is an enthesophyte at the
posterior olecranon.
.
C-spine CT: There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture.
Bulky
calcifications of the posterior longitudinal ligament are
identified at the C2-4 levels, likely resulting in moderate
spinal stenosis.  Multilevel degenerative changes are identified
with disc space and osteophyte formation. Bridging osteophytes
are identified at C7-T2.  The T1-3 processes appear fused.
There is marked irregularity of the inferior endplate of T3 and
superior endplate of T4 with impaction of these vertebral bodies
onto each other and acute kyphotic angulation at this level.
These findings are likely chronic.  There is no prevertebral
soft tissue swelling.  The lung apices are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cervical spine fracture.  Extensive
degenerative changes as described above.
.
Head CT: FINDINGS:  There is hyperdensity along the left frontal
vertex that is likely secondary to volume averaging.  There is
no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures or major
vascular territorial infarction.  Hypodensity in the
periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemia. Small prior infarcts are identified in
the right internal capsule basal ganglia and left external
capsule.  Surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
Bilateral Hip films: Degenerative changes with no definite
fracture.
.
CTA: Impression:
1. no PE
2. enlarged pulmonary arteries
3. lymphadenopathy in mediastinum some of which are calcified
4. calcified hilar lymph nodes
5. pulm lymph nodes along major and minor fissures bilaterally
6. fat density structures in liver and stomach

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary:
Briefly, this is a 81 year old Russian speaking woman who
presented status post fall.  No intracranial bleed. No hip
fracture. + R humerus fracture. CT of c-spine showed severe
stenosis. She was initially admitted to the medicine service for
workup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm
following R humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed
central cord and Brown-Sequard syndrome and transferred to the
neurology service for closer exam monitoring.  She underwent  R
humerus ORIF and C2-C6 laminectomy and fusion on [**2134-3-2**]. A med
consult was obtained on [**2134-3-4**] for persistent hypoxia. She was
gently diuresed, and had serial ABG's which showed persistent
hypercarbia. During the admission, she was also treated with
Cipro for a UTI.
.
Neuro: The patient could not recall the events surrounding the
fall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal
humerus, displaced, and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness
distally in all 4 extremities.  On exam she initially was found
to have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness
affecting arms more so than legs.  She also had evidence of a
brown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on
the right with an upgoing toe, and pin sensation is down on the
left, sensory level of C4/T3 anteriorly on the left (where the
two dermatomes meet at the top of the breast).  She was
complaining of neck pain, and had had trouble voiding so a foley
was placed.
.
MRI of the C-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute
spinal cord injury with above findings.  Read of MRI was: "Bulky
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2/3,
C3/4, and C4/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe
spinal canal stenosis.The cervical cord at those levels is
deformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic T2 hyperintense
signal.  There is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of C3
anteriorly."  She was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain
was controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially.  She was
seen by both neurosurgery and orthopedics for the injury as both
services had been alternately covering the spine service in the
hospital.  Orthopedics also followed her for the broken right
humerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ED
when a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later
proven to be artifactual).
.
Both [**Date Range **] and neurosurgery agreed that it was safest for the
patient to hold off on the spine surgery for at least a week to
allow cord swelling to heal before operating.  She remained in a
hard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next
week; the pinprick sensory level retracted to the T12 region for
days, then finally seemed to vanish altogether; the
proprioceptive changes on the right also resolved.  Although the
right arm remained weak and flaccid with just [**2-28**] finger flexors
and trapezius/shoulder shrug [**2-28**] (initially thought just limited
by pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength
improved to deltoid [**3-31**], [**Hospital1 **]/tri both 4+ to 5-/5, and wrist and
finger extensors 4+/5; finger flexors were also 4+/5.  On [**4-9**]: there were no changes in exam.  For neuropathic pain,
neurontin had been initiated (patient later requested d/c to
simplify med regimen).
.
The weekend of [**2-27**] on morning rounds, a mild right Horner's
syndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily
rounds.  This, along with the flaccid arm, was suggestive of
root avulsion on the right (and associated plexopathy).
Her neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during
hospitalization.
.
[**Date Range 1957**]:
Pt underwent R humerus ORIF and cervical laminectomy (report
below), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted
for hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pCO2
in high 50's). She has a follow up appointment on [**3-18**] with
[**Month/Year (2) **] to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her C-collar
can be removed.
.
Hypoxia/hypercarbia:
Pt had hx of severe pulm HTM, likely [**1-28**] PDA. ABG showed mild
CO2 retention, ? if this was close to her baseline. Also likely
had component of fluid overload, given recent surgery.  Pt was
gently diuresed with IV Lasix. Narcotics were d/c'd as pt
appeared somnolent. O2 was successfully weaned down to 2L NC (pt
apparently had been on 2L O2 at home). CTA on admission was
negative for PE, and the suspicion for PE was fairly low post-op
given that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement
improved.  Therefore, repeat CTA was not done. She was also
noted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory
status remained stable while on the medicine service.
.
Status post fall: The original fall was of unclear etiology. The
differential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset
afib/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness. Less
likely include myocardial infarction/ischemia versus pulmonary
embolism versus seizure. Also less likely hypoglycemia given
timing after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally
cleared in setting of increased creatinine.  The patient ruled
out for MI by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe
valvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry
showed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib.  She had no
other significant tele events while in the hospital.
.
Elevated WBC and lactate at admission: unclear etiology,
afebrile with negative UA and infectious workup at admission.
This cleared on its own.  Later in hospitalization ([**2-27**]) she had
a UTI treated with course of ciprofloxacin. Urine cxlood cx, and
cath tip cx were sent prior to d/c to workup somnolence, however
pt's somnolence cleared and cx's were pending on d/c. These
should be followed at her follow up appointments.
.
Musculoskeletal: initially, radiographic imaging was negative
for fracture or bleed including right UE, hips bilaterally,
c-spine and head. Patient with known chronic low back pain and
sciatica.
.
Hypertension/pulmonary hypertension: continued ASA, held
valsartan. lasix initially held for renal failure but was
restarted once she was clinically stable.
.
Hypercholesterolemia: continued home dose of lipitor
.
Renal: She has slight renal insufficiency at admission and was
given gentle IVF. Her electrolytes were followed and repleted as
needed, MVI and continued niferex.  ARF improved. She should
have her potassium and BUN/creatinine followed at regular
intervals starting 2-3 days post discharge, as she was
discharged on her home dose of [**Last Name (un) **] and new dose of lasix.

Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on TEDS, SQ heparin,
PPI, bowel regimen.  She complained of RLE pain one day, and u/s
was ordered to r/o dvt - this study was negative.

PROCEDURE:  IM nail right humerus.

ASSISTANT:  [**Last Name (un) 1965**].

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old
woman who sustained a fall and has a displaced right proximal
humerus fracture. She also has a spine injury and this has
been operated on by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1966**]. Given the displacement of
her fracture and that she is having pain and not tolerating
nonoperative treatment, we decided to proceed with
intramedullary nailing.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1967**] had completed his spinal portion
of the case, the patient was placed in the supine position.
The right arm was prepped and draped in normal sterile
fashion.

A 3 cm incision was made over the proximal humerus and the
deltoid was split. Eentry point was established in the
proximal humerus and the guide wire placed. The fracture was
held reduced and the guide wire passed into the distal
humerus. The proximal part of the humerus was reamed and
then the canal was reamed up to a size 10 mm. Next a 230 by
10 mm [**Doctor Last Name 1968**] and Nephew nail was placed and interlocked with 2
screws proximally. The distal locking screw was placed under
image intensification. Wounds were irrigated and closed with
0 Vicryl, 2-0 and a subcuticular 3-0. Postoperatively, she
was brought back to the recovery room in stable condition.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

As the attending surgeon I was present for and performed the
entire procedure.

History of Present Illness:
82yo Russian speaking F with a PMH of type II DM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, obesity, pulmonary HTN and anemia, who presented
to the ED this AM with worsening SOB x 2 weeks. Per the ED
resident, the patient noted that she had had worsening SOB x 2
weeks (documented as 2 days [**Name8 (MD) **] RN note) and also complained of
orthopnea and increasing lower extremity swelling and weeping
from a venous stasis ulcer on her L shin. The patient was able
to communicate this verbally to ER resident (RN notes she was
only able to speak in 4 word sentences). Her VNA stated that she
was only 94% on 2L O2 at home and had rales [**12-28**] way up
bilaterally. On initial assessment in the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, her vital
signs were T 98.2, BP 167/60, HR 61, RR 23, sats 100% on RA. On
next assessment (2 hrs later), pt was felt to be very SOB while
attempting to use the bed pan. RN noted her to be dusky,
diaphoretic. HR 72, RR 28, sats 90% on RA. She was placed on a
NRB with improvement in her O2 sats to 98%. BP rose to 210/74,
then 215/93. CXR was taken and read as c/w pneumonia. Blood cx
were obtained and ceftriaxone was administtered. 90 mins later,
she was felt to be diaphoretic again, with increased work of
breathing. Her O2 sats dropped to 90% by NRB and she was prepped
for intubation. She was given 2mg versed and was intubated. SBP
210 -> 178 -> 130. She was taken to CT scan for CTA. On return
from CT scan, she was felt to be bucking the vent. She was given
fentanyl 100mcg, with resultant drop in her SBP to 77. She was
then bolused 1L of NS with improvement in her SBP to 96. She was
also given vecuronium 10mg IV and ativan 1mg IV because of
inability to ventilate and biting at the tube.
.
On review, she was given: 1gm CTX IV x1, ? azithromcyin 500mg IV
x1, lasix 20mg x1, 120mg succinylcholine IV, etomidate 20mg IV,
12.5mg versed IV, and fentanyl 100mcg x1. She was also given 1
dose of mucomyst prior to her CT scan.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Most likely explanation is acute diastolic CHF ("flash"
pulmonary edema) given acute onset and associated HTN.  No
evidence of structural heart disease on echo. ? findings of PNA,
and unclear what to make of other findings on CTA--lymphoma vs
TB. Pt does have an elevated LDH, but it was felt these were
unlikely possibilities.  Pt was treated for CHF with diuresis
and improved.  She was extubated and respiratory status
continued to improve fitting with CHF as the etiology.  She
should have a repeat CT to evaluate the lymphadenopathy.  She
was also empirically treated with pneumonia with azithro but she
was afebrile with nml WBC.  She was continued on losartan, beta
blockade.
.
2) CV:  As above.  Continued on aspirin.  No evidence of acute
ischemia.
.
3) ANEMIA, iron deficiency:
Baseline Hct 28-30, at baseline on discharge. On niferex as an
outpatient. Iron studies checked at last visit--Fe/TIBC ~15%.
Continued on iron for iron deficieny.
.
4) HTN: Contine Metoprolol, [**Last Name (un) **]

.
ECG:  Sinus rhythm at 76 bpm with evidence of RVH, normal axis
and intervals, no ST-T changes.
.
Imaging:
[**2136-4-4**] Chest x-ray:
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.
Evaluation is somewhat limited by underpenetrated technique.
There is no definite evidence of pneumonia. Heart size is
stable. Pulmonary arterial prominence is noted compatible with
patient's given history of pulmonary hypertension.
Atherosclerotic calcification at the aorta is noted. There is no
pneumothorax. Diffuse demineralized bone is noted with
post-surgical changes of the right proximal humerus.
.
Abdominal CT:Large right rectus muscle hematoma approximately
10.1x4.4x15.2 cm.
.
Echocardiogram on [**2136-3-26**]:
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 84 year-old female with a history of pulmonary
hypertension, diastolic CHF, who presented with weakness,
hypotension, Guaiac positive stools.
.

# Hypotension - Her hypotension and anemia were felt to be due
to blood loss from rectus sheath hematoma.  Unknown exactly how
the hematoma occurred (?secondary to heparin injection while
recently hospitalized)but was well visualized on the abdominal
CT that she had in the ER.  She was evaluated by GI (due to
anemia and guaiac positive stools), who found external
hemorrhoids on exam and stated there was little or no concern
regarding duodenal angioectasia as source of hematocrit drop.
They followed and plans for c-scope if she started bleeding
again.   Her Hct was 22 on admission, microcytic.  She received
3 units of blood in total and her hematocrit stablized at 29-30
for several days.  Her blood pressure was 80/40 on admission and
she was admitted to the MICU, but did not require pressors, her
BP increased with blood and fluids (2L).  In the ICU she was on
a po PPI, had two large bore IVs, as well as central access.
Her Hct was checked q6 hours and transfusion parameter was 26.
Her aspirin was held.  Her BP increased to teens over 80's and
she was transferred to the medical floor after one day in the
MICU.  On the medical floor her blood pressure remained in the
120's/80's initially but then increased to 140's.  Her
lisinopril, valsartan, metoprolol and furosemide were held
initially due to her relatively low blood pressure and increased
creatinine (see below). Her furosemide was restarted on the last
day of hospitalization due to blood pressure that would tolerate
it and signs of hypervolemia.
In addition she had several bowel movements on the day prior to
admission, likely due to many laxatives she was receiving.  She
did not have a  leukocytosis, fever.  The stool was guiaic
negative.  Her laxatives were discontinued except docusate.
.
# Acute renal failure - Pre-renal secondary to
hypotension/hypovolemia.  C Her electrolytes and volume status
were stable.  Her lisinopril, lasix and valsartan were held and
continue to be held as her blood pressure is in the 130's.  Her
creatinine was 3.4 on admission with a baseline of 1.6.  Her
creatinine decreased to 1.4 after hydration and her lasix was
restarted at her home dose of 80mg po bid.
.
# Leukocytosis - WBC on admission was very high, likely
reactive, given hypotension, and acute blood loss.  Blood and
urine cultures were negative and she had no diarrhea.  Her CXR
was unremarkable and antibiotics were deferred as there was no
source of infection, she was afebrile and her leukocytosis
resolved (WBC was 7 for the last two days of admission).
.
# Hyperlipidemia - She continued to take atorvastatin
.
# Chronic pain - She continued to take gabapentin
.
# Diabetes mellitus - insulin sliding scale while in house, once
creatinine normalized glipizide 2.5mg q daily was re-started.
.
# Psych - Continued paroxetine

No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old lady with a PMH of diastolic heart
failure (EF>75%), severe lung disease and resultant pulmonary
hypertension, T2DM, obesity, who presents from home with hypoxia
and worsening somnolence.

Patient reports that since discharge from the hospital on
Saturday [**11-21**], she has had persistent increased sputum which
she has difficulty coughing up.  She feels like the sputum gets
caught in her throat.  It is white-clear.  She denies fever or
chills.  She denies worsening dyspnea, but has only ambulated in
her house as she hasn't been feeling well.  She endorses mild
orthopnea.  She denies worsening lower extremity edema.

Of note, patient was recently admitted for hypoxia with CXR
findings of a LUL.  She had presented to her cardiologist one
week prior to initial admission with complaints of worsening
dyspnea and increased sputum production, without fever or
leukocytosis.  At that time, cardiologist felt that patient was
having an acute flare of her chronic bronchitis, and placed her
on a one week course of levofloxacin.  A CXR was performed at
the time to rule out pneumonia which was negative for
consolidation.  She followed up with the cardiologist NP one
week later, and was found to have O2Sats ranging from 68-80% on
3L NC (baseline, home oxygen).  She continued to be afebrile
without leukocytosis but reported no improvement in sputum
production or dyspnea.  She was sent to the ER where a repeat
CXR showed bilateral upper lobe opacities concerning for
pneumonia.  She was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and
admitted to the medicine service.  Antibiotics were not
continued as patient was afebrile, without cough or
leukocytosis.  Right lower extremity ultrasound was negative for
DVT.  Patient was discharged home as her oxygen saturations
returned to baseline on home 3L NC.

[**Name (NI) **] son reports that patient had BCG vaccination in
[**Country 532**].  He does not know if she was ever exposed to
tuberculosis.  He does not know of anyone in his family who was
exposed to tuberculosis.

In the ED inital vitals were 97.4 70 141/47 18 100%

ABG 7.35/91/105/46. She was given vanc/cefepime x1.  Lung exam
c/w decreased breath sounds, tachypneic to low 30s. She was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

On arrival to the ICU, vital signs were 97.6, 69, 132/56, 18 and
96% on 3LNC.  Patient was comfortable and denied any pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with a history of diastolic heart failure, pulmonary
hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and chronic bronchitis
admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure. Hospital course
notable for acute renal failure.

#Hypoxia/Atypical Pneumonia/Pulmonary hypertension/Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease/Acute on chronic diastolic heart
failure/Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
Patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with
hypercarbic respiratory which was felt to be due to over
oxygenation, and most likely worsening pulmonary hypertension
from volume overload and atypical pneumonia. She was diuresed
and treated with azithromycin with improvement in her symptoms.
She was also seen by the Pulmonary service for evaluation of her
pulmonary hypertension and episodes of apnea and they
recommended an outpatient sleep study. The patient did well and
was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the medical
floor and improved with antibiotics and further diuresis and was
discharged on home oxygen of 2-3L NC. Given that
over-ventilation and over-oxygenation was felt to contribute to
the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence,
the patient should have oxygen for a target oxygen saturation of
89-93%.

#Pulmonary nodules:
Patient had sputum production and a chest CT which showed 3 left
uppe lobe lung nodules that were most likely felt to be
infectious. She was ruled out for TB with 3 negative sputa for
AFB and patient received course of azithromycin. She should have
a follow up CXR in 6 weeks. Patient and son were made aware of
this and the importance of follow up.

#Acute on chronic diastolic Heart Failure:
As above patient was admitted in volume overload. Hospital
course was notable for improvement in symptoms with diuresis,
but complicated by acute renal failure (see below). Patient was
ultimately discharged euvolemic on regimen of Lasix 80mg once
daily to keep her euvolemic and TBB even.

#Acute on Chronic renal Failure:
During diuresis for acute heart failure, patient developed acute
renal failure with probable contraction alkalosis. At this point
diuresis was stopped, gentle fluids were given, and diuretics
were stared when renal function had returned to [**Location 213**].
Lisinopril was held and should be started 3 days after discharge
at 2.5mg po daily.

# Hypertension: Blood pressure was well controlled on home
regimen. Diltiazem was continued but Lisinopril was held during
acute renal failure.

# Diabetes mellitus:  HgbA1c 6.5 in 7/[**2138**].  On glipizide at
home. Patient was covered with sliding scale insulin in the
hospital. Glipizide can be restarted once renal function
stabilizes.

# Transitional issues:
AFB cultures will need to be followed-up
She will need close pulmonary follow-up for repeat imaging in
several weeks (fu of pulmonary nodules as well as follow up of
her likely COPD, severe pulmonary hypertension, and probable
sleep apnea
.
#Disposition: Patient was discharged to rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mrs [**Known lastname **]:

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital during your
stay; You were taken care of by a critical care team during your
ICU stay and a medicine primary team during your inpatient
hospitalization.  During your stay you received treatment for
congestive heart failure and continued treatment for a possible
pneumonia.  You will need to continue to restrict your salt
intake in order to prevent exacerbations of your heart failure.

Additionally, there was significant concern that you have
obstructive sleep apnea. You have appointments to see a sleep
medicine specialist and a pulmonologist.

The following changes were made to your medication regimen:
1) START guaifenesin  100 mg/5 mL Syrup  Sig:  Ten (10) ML PO
Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sputum production/cough
2) START albuterol 0.083% neb solution, 1 nebulizer every 4
hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing
3) You may use saline nasal spray as needed for nasal dryness.
4) Your lasix dose was decreased to 80mg once daily (instead of
twice per day).
.
Please try to avoid ibuprofen and other NSAIDs orally if
possible because these could further damage your kidneys.
Please be sure to weigh yourself every morning and call your
primary care doctor if weight is increasing by more than 3 lbs.
You may need to have your lasix increased again.

Please be sure to keep all of your followup appointments as
listed below, including your followup with the cardiologist next
week.
.
No other changes were made to your medications and you should
continue to take all your other medications as originally
prescribed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Orthopedic service on [**2139-12-25**]
for a right subtrochanteric femur fracture after being evaluated
and treated with closed reduction in the emergency room. She was
noted to have a Hct=25.7, with a baseline of 30-32, so she was
given 2 units of packed red cells overnight. In addition, she
received one dose of kayexalate for hyperkalemia to 5.7 without
EKG changes. She underwent open reduction internal fixation of
the fracture without complication on [**2139-12-26**]. Please see
operative report for full details. She was extubated without
difficulty and transferred to the recovery room in stable
condition. In the early post-operative course Ms. [**Known lastname **]
developed anuria, with a creatinine bump above her baseline, and
she was transferred to the TSICU for further monitoring and
treatment of her volume status and worsening renal
insufficiency. During this time, she was transfused an
additional 2 units of packed red cells. She remained in the ICU
overnight and eventually showed improvement with good urine
output, and was transferred to the floor in stable condition.

On hospital day 3 she was transfused an additional 2 units of
packed red cells for post-operative anemia. On hospital day 5,
she received a visit from the Russian Cardiology Service who
recommended restarting her home Lasix, which was done.

She continued to make good urine had adequate pain management
and worked with physical therapy while in the hospital.  The
remainder of her hospital course was uneventful and Ms.
[**Known lastname **] is being discharged to rehab in stable condition. She
will follow with both her Cardiologist and Orthopedic trauma
team in 4 and 2 weeks, respectively.

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old man
with a past medical history significant for coronary artery
disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting in
[**2128-10-21**], at which time they performed a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous
vein graft to the OM-I and OM-II sequential and saphenous
vein graft to the PDA.  He is also status post stenting of
his saphenous vein graft to the OM-I, OM-II territory in
[**2135-3-21**], and PTCA and brachytherapy to the saphenous
vein graft to the OM-I, OM-II in [**2137-12-21**].   The
patient also has a past medical history significant for
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, depression, mild dementia, history of
TIA, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies in [**2134**].

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a long-standing
history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted [**2138-12-2**] due to unstable angina with a troponin level ranging
between 4.5 and 5.9.  Cardiac catheterization was performed
on [**2138-12-2**] which revealed a patent left internal
mammary artery graft, occluded OM-1 and OM-2 graft, and a 90%
occlusion in the in-stented segment of the PDA.  The last
echocardiogram was performed in [**2137-5-21**] which revealed a
left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

12. Nitroglycerin patch.
13. Plavix which is being held.
14. NPH insulin 12 units q.a.m., 8 units q.p.m., regular
insulin 4 units q.a.m.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  An off-pump redo coronary artery bypass
grafting was performed on [**2138-12-8**].  It was a
coronary artery bypass grafting times one with the saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal via left thoracotomy
incision.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery
Unit in stable condition on Neo-Synephrine at 0.6 micrograms
per kilogram per minute and propofol in normal sinus rhythm
at 57 beats per minute.  He was extubated the same day of
surgery without any incidents around 6:00 p.m.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had a low-grade
temperature at 100.3 in sinus rhythm at 88.  The vital signs
were stable.  The white count was 9.1, hematocrit 31.3,
platelet count 147,000 with an unremarkable physical
examination.  The plan was to continue to keep his blood
pressure down on Nipride and to start the patient on his p.o.
medications as well as his p.o. diet.  If able to wean off
the Nipride, the plan was to transfer the patient to the
floor.

On postoperative day number two, the patient was mildly
disoriented, however, calm without complaints with his pain
well controlled.  He was still with a low-grade temperature
of 100.1 in sinus rhythm at 88, mildly hypertensive at
170/88.  On physical examination, he had mild crackles
bilaterally, otherwise his examination was benign.  The plan
was just to continue monitor his mental status and pain
control.

On postoperative day number three, the patient was still
without complaints, however, still requiring a sitter for his
disorientation.  Currently, afebrile.  The vital signs were
stable, saturating at 94% on room air.  The physical
examination was benign.  The plan was to go for a cardiac
catheterization this morning with a possible PTCA with plus
or minus stenting of the stenotic area.

He did undergo cardiac catheterization on [**2138-12-11**]
which now revealed a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse
marginal patent and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending artery with a 90% distal stenosis with a 3 by 13
mm stent with distal protection and 0% residual with normal
flow.  The plan was to continue the patient on aspirin and
Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for 30 days and to administer
Integrelin overnight.

The anticipated date of discharge is [**2138-12-12**].  The
patient is to be discharged home on the following
medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metformin 850 mg p.o. b.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 41-year-old
male with a longstanding history of seizure disorder and
mental retardation who presented to the Emergency Room with a
possible asthma exacerbation, as well as some right arm
shaking. The patient has a longstanding seizure disorder, by
report both GTC and complex partial. The patient's seizures
have been relatively well controlled for the past year up to
a few weeks ago. The patient did have an episode of
unresponsiveness thought to be a postictal state. He was
recently admitted on [**2193-5-24**] at [**Hospital6 649**] for asthma exacerbation. He was seen by
Neurology at that time for questioned seizure activity. His
Keppra was increased during that hospitalization from 5,000
b.i.d. to 2,000 b.i.d.

On the morning of admission, the patient was found by EMS to
have an O2 saturation in the 80s and appeared apneic. It was
felt that he again was having an asthmatic exacerbation. He
was intubated in the field and brought to [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. At [**Hospital6 2018**], he was noted to have some right arm shaking, which
was felt to be a seizure episode. He received 8 mg of Ativan
and was placed on propofol. He was also noted to have some
teeth chattering.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Seizure disorder.

Anoxic brain injury.

Asthma.

Depression.

Fetal alcohol syndrome.

Cervical fracture.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No seizure disorders.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in group home with 24 hour
supervision. No smoking or drinking history.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Depakote 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Keppra 2,000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Valium 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Neurontin 800 mg t.i.d.
5. Celexa 40 mg p.o. q d.
6. Albuterol nebulizer.
7. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Pseudoephedrine 30 mg p.o. q.i.d.


ALLERGIES:  Phenobarbital, phenytoin, penicillin, Haldol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 100.0, heart
rate 76, blood pressure 132/77, saturation of 100 percent on
vent assist control/650/20/5 on 85 percent, not
overbreathing, PIP-31. General:  Intubated, sedated male,
appearing slightly rigid. HEENT:  Pupils were 2 cm minimally
reactive to light. Lungs:  Expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs or
gallops. Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds. Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema,
2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
Neurological:  The patient was sedated, but would withdraw to
pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

Respiratory:  The patient was continued on q.i.d. albuterol
nebulizations. His sedation was lightened and he was
successfully extubated the following day. Admission arterial
blood gas was 7.48/39/404. It was uncertain whether or not
the patient actually had asthmatic exacerbation. He was
initially given Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenously. However,
this was discontinued the following day. He appeared stable
with regard to his respiratory status at the time of
discharge. He did not have an AA gradient.

Neurological:  A Neurology consult was obtained at the time
of admission. Since there were no clear jerking or rhythmic
movements and since the patient's group home representatives
stated that this was not his typical seizure activity, it was
unclear whether or not the patient was actually having
seizures. At the time of admission, he received 8 mg of
Ativan. His outpatient regimen of seizure medications was
continued. This included Depakote, Keppra, valium and
Neurontin. The patient had no obvious seizure activity during
his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay. An electroencephalogram
was obtained by the Neurology service, which was consistent
with encephalopathy, but did not reveal any seizure activity.
Levels of valproate were measured and found to be within
range.

Mental Status:  The patient was initially fairly somnolent.
However, over the course of the day, he was able to become
more alert. A representative from the patient's group home
was scheduled to see the patient to decide whether or not he
was at his baseline. The patient was able to eat and take his
medications without difficulty during his hospitalization.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To group home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Mental retardation.

Seizure disorder.

Asthma.

Depression.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  No changes were made to the patient's
outpatient regimen.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is with mental
retardation, seizure disorder, asthma, and recurrent
aspiration pneumonia, who was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit already intubated for apnea.

On the day of admission, the patient was sitting bolt upright
in bed in respiratory distress.  He was given Albuterol neb
without improvement.  At that time his oxygen saturation was
88 percent, and he was intubated for apnea.

An initial chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe opacities
consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  He was extubated on
the day after admission.

On presentation the patient was febrile and started on
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  He was
called out to the floor three days after admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Seizure disorder secondary to anoxic
brain injury.  Over the past three months, the patient has
had increasing seizure activity from baseline according to
his primary caretaker.

Mental retardation.

Asthma.

Depression.

Fetal alcohol syndrome.

Recurrent aspiration pneumonia.

History of positive PPD.

Status post fall in [**2188**] with a C7 fracture.

History of multiple psychiatric admissions (The patient can
be combative and assaultive at times).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Depakote 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Neurontin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d., Celexa 30 mg p.o. q.d.,
Albuterol nebs q.6 hours p.r.n., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Atrovent, Keppra [**2188**] mg p.o. b.i.d., Valium 10 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Citalopram.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No seizure disorder.

ALLERGIES:  Phenobarbital, Penicillin, Haldol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Upon transfer to the
Medical Floor, temperature was 97.9 with a T-max of 101,
pulse 83, ranging from 51-126, blood pressure 110/47,
respirations 21, ranging from 21-32, oxygen saturation 97
percent on 4 L nasal cannula.  General:  Examination was
significant for a young black male in no acute distress.  The
patient was awake and responding to voice appropriately.
HEENT:  Moist mucous membranes.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Neck:  Supple.  Cardiovascular:  Normal
S1 and S2.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Decreased
breath sounds at the bases with a few audible wheezes.
Abdomen:  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 6.4, hematocrit 40.5;
creatinine 0.9,  1.6.

ASSESSMENT:  This was a 41-year-old male with mental
retardation, recently worsening seizure disorder, on triple
medication therapy, admitted with  aspiration and probable
aspiration pneumonia.

Aspiration pneumonia:  The patient was treated with a seven-
day course of Levofloxacin.  He was initially treated with
Flagyl; however, this was discontinued before day 7 because
of his tendency to decreased seizure threshold.  The patient
was placed on aspiration precautions.

During his hospitalization, he had multiple episodes of
unresponsiveness, which were likely post ictal states.  In
addition, he had multiple seizure activity, and therefore was
deemed to unstable to go down for a video swallow.  A bed
side speech and swallow evaluation recommended ground/pureed
food with thickened liquids.  The patient tolerated this diet
well.

In addition, the patient was placed on a quick steroid taper
with nebs p.r.n.

After starting antibiotics, the patient remained afebrile for
the rest of his admission, and his lung examination
normalized.  He was on room air at the time of this
dictation.

Seizure disorder:  Over the past few months, the patient's
seizure disorder has been worsening.  Initially on admission,
his Keppra dose was decreased to 1500 b.i.d.  He was
continued on his home dose of Valproic Acid and Gabapentin.
The patient had multiple episodes of witnessed seizures, some
tonic and two short tonic clonic seizures.  These responded
to intravenous Ativan; however, on two episodes, he had
probable seizure activity with bilateral  up and out for more
than 20 min.

Neurology was consulted.  The patient received two EEGs
during his hospitalization, both of which did not demonstrate
seizure activity.  There was generalized swelling, likely due
to medication affect.  The patient was transferred to the
Epilepsy Service for continuous monitoring.

Psychiatric:  The patient has a history of combative behavior
and multiple psychiatric security codes being called.  A
similar code was called during this hospitalization.

Psychiatry was involved and recommended  p.r.n. for
agitation.

Prior to transfer to the Neurology Service, the patient's
dose of Keppra was increased back to his home dose of [**2188**] mg
p.o. b.i.d.

The patient was maintained on seizure precautions.

The patient is full code.

This portion of the dictation summary was dictated by the
General Medicine Team.  An addendum will be dictated by the
Neurology Service after the patient receives continuous EEG
monitoring.

CXR ([**2180-10-29**]):
Ill-defined hazy opacities in both lungs, worse within the left
perihilar
region, with increased size of the cardiac silhouette and small
left pleural effusion. Findings most likely relate to pulmonary
edema. Underlying infection or neoplasm, as noted on the prior
CT within the left lung cannot be discerned on this exam.
.
TTE ([**2180-10-30**]):
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. There is brief right ventricular
diastolic compression/collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology. Moderate pericardial effusion
with echo evidence of tamponade.
.
CT Chest With Contrast ([**2180-10-30**]):
No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Massive progression of
disease with substantial generalized severe mediastinal and
hilar lymphadenopathy, newly appeared bilateral pleural
effusions, newly appeared pericardial effusion, newly appeared
multifocal pneumonia, and evidence of lymphangitis
carcinomatosa.
.
TTE ([**2180-10-31**]):
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a very small pericardial effusion which is partially
echodense. The pericardium may be thickened but is not well
visualized. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2180-10-30**], the pericardial effusion is now much smaller.
.
CXR [**2180-11-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Further progression of metastatic breast cancer
disease with
pericardial effusion, extensive infiltrates in left lower lobe,
and additional
probably metastatic spread in other lung regions. It cannot be
decided
whether the described findings have any relevance to
therapeutically-induced
fluid overload.
.
ECHO [**2180-11-3**]: Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old woman with a PMH significant for metastatic breast
cancer with lung and brain metastases admitted originally to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of respiratory distress, then transferred to
CCU after pericardiocentesis for cardiac tampoande, then
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 2035**] after pt's respiratory status stabilized.
.
#. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: On presentation to the ICU, the
patient denied any fevers but reported a productive cough of
several months duration. CXR on arrival demonstrated left
peri-hilar and basilar infiltrates with concern for infectious
consolidation/pneumonia, pleural effusion or progression of
metastatic disease as her cancer was known to be located in the
left lower lobe. A CT with contrast was performed to further
evaluate the intrapulmonary process and demonstrated a
multifocal pneumonia, progression of the pulmonary metastases,
pleural effusions as well as a moderate-to-large pericardial
effusion (see below for management of pericardial effusion) but
was negative for a pulmonary embolism. Given productive cough
and radiographic evidence the patient was started on Levaquin
and Vancomycin for robust CAP treatment. On review of her
medical chart, HCAP was considered more likely and she was
started on Levoquin and Cefipime. Blood and urine cultures were
performed and showed no growth as well as an Influenza DFA,
which was negative. The patient was maintained on oxygen by
nasal canula to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than 90%.
Urine culture showed no growth though UA was positive for
leukocytes, as she was already on broad spectrim antibiotics, no
additional coverage was added. Antibiotics were changed to
Levaquin and flagyl to cover postobstructive pneumonia, she will
finish a course of 8 days on [**2180-11-8**]. On [**10-31**], patient spiked
fever to 100.9 and cefipime was restarted. After arrival to
[**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so
Cepfepime was dc'd again.  Pulmonary was consulted and per their
recs, Vanc was restarted and Flagyl was dc'd after 5 days.  Pt
ultimately completed 8d of Levoquin and at time of discharge,
Vanc was changed to Linezolid to complete the course at home.
Cough was treated symptomatically.  Pt was discharged with O2
suppl.
.
#. Pericardial Effusion: Patient was tachycardic on
presentation. There was concern that it may be related to the
patient's hypoxia or another underlying process such as a PE or
possibly hypovolemia. Antibiotics for her pneumonia as above.
Intravenous fluids were given for hypovolemia with little change
in heart rate. A CT was ordered as above to evaluate further,
which was negative for a pulmonary embolism but did reveal a
moderate-to-large pericardial effusion. A TTE was ordered to
evaluate further and revealed evidence of tamponade physiology.
Moreover, the patient had a pulsus paradoxus of 16-18 mm Hg on
exam. The interventional cardiology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] who
performed pericardiocentesis which produced 470mL serosanguanous
fluid which was consistent with exudate by lites criteria. Over
the next day, the drain put out another 500cc of fluid. The
fluid was sent for cultures which were all negative.  Cytology
on pericarial fluid was positive for malignant cells. After one
day, the pericardial drain was pulled, and the tip sent for
culture which was also negative, and the patient was transfered
out of the CCU. After arrival to [**Name (NI) 2035**], pt remained stable on NC,
however clinically appeared still distressed.  On [**2180-11-3**], a
repeat ECHO was performed and it showed small pericardical
effusion, reassuring us that the fluid had not reaccumulated.
Per Cardiology recs, pt was instrusted to get another repeat
ECHO on [**2180-11-22**] when she return for her outpt appt with
oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] will follow-up on the ECHO
results.
.
# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a mild
metabolic acidosis and an anion gap of 15. The most immediate
concern was for a lactic acidosis from her respiratory distress
and impaired tissue oxygenation or a possible starvation
ketosis. Repeat labs the morning after admission revealed a
worsening of her acidosis with a HCO3 of 15 (down from 20 on
admission). An ABG revealed an appropriate respiratory
compensation with a pCO2 of 31. The metabolic acidosis soon
resolved and pt remained stable.
.
# Breast cancer: CT on admission showed dramatic progression of
metastatic disease involving the lungs bilaterally. She was
continued on capecitabine 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **], and transfered to the
oncology service. Once on [**Hospital1 2035**], given pt's breast cancer was
progressing on current therapy (CA27-29 rising) and pt's
clinical status was deteriorating, inpt attending and outpt
oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] discussed started a new chemotherapy
regimen.  Thus, pt's capecitabine was stopped and on [**2180-11-3**] pt
was given Herceptin, Docetaxel and Carboplatin.  20 minutes into
the infusion, Herceptin was stopped bc pt developed SOB and
hypoxia to mid 80s.  Pt's symptoms resolved with time, Ativan
and Lasix.  Herceptin was attempted again on [**2180-11-6**].  This
time the infusion was stopped 60 min into the infusion bc pt
developed tachycardia. Pt's symptoms resolved with time.  Pt was
started on Neupogen 24 hours after chemotherapy administration
to prevent neutropenia.  The Neupogen was discontinued on day of
discharge as pt's WBC was still >15.
.
# Elevated LFTs: Pt had midly elevated LFTs after chemo
administration, which were trending down with time.
.
# Diarrhea:  Pt developed diarrhea during the hospitalization.
C diff was negative.  Likely [**12-28**] chemo.  Diarrhea improved with
Imodium.
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was approximately 39, at the
patient's known baseline. The patient subsequently received
several liters of intravenous fluids for her tachycardia and her
hematocrit came down to 35. Pt's Hct remained stable in the
31-35 range.  Pt did not require any transfusions.
.
# Crohn's: Patient was continued on her Mesalamine without
event.
.
# Pt was on regular diet.  Pt was full code.  Pt was on SC
Heparin for DVT ppx.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to participate in your care Ms. [**Known lastname 284**].
You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.  We
found that you had extra fluid around your heart and you had a
drain placed to remove the fluid.  We also found that you had
worsened metastatic breast cancer that has spread to your lungs.
 This made it difficult for you to breathe.  We started new
chemotherapy, which helped to improve your symptoms.  We also
treated you for pneumonia during your hospitalization.  You will
go home with supplemental oxygen.

Please make the following changes to your medications:
1. Stop xeloda
2. Please start linazolid 600 mg twice a day for three days (you
will finish course on [**2180-11-10**]
3. Start metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day - this medication helps
to slow your heart rate
4. Start benzonatate 100 mg Capsule every 4 hours as needed for

Pelvic Ultrasound [**2103-7-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Fibroid uterus.
2. Normal appearing ovaries bilaterally. No ovarian torsion seen
at the time of the exam, although clinical correlation is needed
to entirely exclude this diagnosis.
3. Mild-to-moderate amount of nonspecific free pelvic fluid.

Abdominal CT [**2103-7-25**]:
ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a trace right pleural
effusion and slight atelectasis at the right lung base. The NG
tube extends into the stomach, where it makes a loop in the
fundus. There is a large amount of fluid in the peritoneum. The
liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and ureters
appear unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended without CT
evidence of wall edema.

The proximal small bowel is collapsed. The mid small bowel is
distended with air-fluid levels. The distal small bowel is not
distended. Rectal contrast opacifies the colon, reaching the
cecum. There is severe thickening of the cecal wall. The
appendix seems to be normal in caliber although surrounded by
inflammatory changes and fluid . These findings are most
consistent with cecitis, which could be infectious or
inflammatory. Ischemic etiology is less likely.

PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST: The uterus is enlarged with multiple
fibroids, some of which demonstrate calcified rims. The bladder
and rectum are unremarkable. There is a large amount of fluid
tracking down from the abdomen.

BONE WINDOWS: The visualized osseous structures appear
unremarkable.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions were essential
in evaluating bowel anatomy. There is severe cecal wall
thickening. The appendix is normal in caliber.

IMPRESSION:
1) Inflammatory changes in the rigth lower quadrant most likely
consistent with cecitis, which could be infectious or
inflammatory. Ischemic etiology less likely.
2) Large amount of intraperitoneal fluid.
3) Dilated mid small bowel loops, likely secondary to ileus.
4) Fibroid uterus.

Pathology:
Appendix:
    Acute appendicitis with acute serositis.
     No evidence of vasculitis seen.
Ileocecal resection specimen:

1.  Ileum and proximal margin:
Vascular congestion.

2.  Colon:
a.  Severe vascular congestion, submucosal edema, and transmural
acute hemorrhage.
b.  Areas of acute transmural ischemic infarction (slides C and
D).
c.  Distal margin:  No infarction.
d.  No convincing evidence of a primary vasculitis.  Scattered
small veins have mural acute inflammation and fibrin thrombi,
but these changes are almost certainly secondary to the colonic
wall injury.
e.  One lymph node:  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

Peritoneal fluid:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

Echocardiogram:
 Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral
valve. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small
circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for
hemodynamic
compromise.

IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion. No 2D
echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis identified.+


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially taken emergently to the operating room
for exploratory laparascopy with general surgery back up.  She
was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.  They observed a
normal left tube and [**Last Name (un) 2046**], and copius greenish yellow fluid, as
well as right lower quadrant adhesions and a diffusely inflammed
small intestine.  The General surgery team became infvolved and
noted that the appendix was acutely inflamed but there was no
other pathology.  after completion of the exploratory
laparatomy, the patient remained tachycardic, with otherwise
stable vital signs, but required >15 L of resucitation.  Despite
this the patients Hematocrit rose from 41.3 to 52, and her WBC
rose form 12.9 to 39.7.  The patients urine output also began to
decrease.  The patient was becoming edematous and the patient
had increased respiratory distress.  it was believed that the
patient was third spacing, and the patient was transferred to
the intensive care unit for monitoring.

On post op day 2, the patient was taken back for a reexploration
given that the patient had the hemodynamics above, and the
patients abdominal exam worsened.  In the operating room they
discovered a retroperitoneum that was diffulsely petichial and
ecchymotic, with significant retroperitoneal edema and bowel
edema.  the appendages eppiplocae were hemorrhagic.  There was
pathc purpuring darkening concerning for ischemia of the cecum.
The patient underwent a right colectomy, with an ileosotomy and
right transverse colon mucous fistula.  the patient could not be
closed and the abdomen was left open.  The patient was sent back
to the intensive care unit, intubated.  The infectious disease
and rheumatology services were consulted and were intimately
involved, and the results of the studies they suggested are
listed above.

The patients hemodynamic status improved, although the patient
remained tachycardic and intermittently febrile, although
cultures remained negative and the patient remained on broad
spectrum antibiotics.  She continued to recieve fluid boluses
for decreased urine output on post operative days 3 and 1.  TPN
was started on post operative days 4 and 2.  On post operative
days 5 and 3, the patient had an echocardiogram to rule out an
embolic source for possible mesenteric ischemia, and a HIT panel
was sent for decreased platelets.  On post operative days 6 and
4 the patient was brought back to the operating room for closure
of her abdomen.  A vent wean was started on post operative days
7,5,and 1 and continued until postoperative days 10/8/4 when she
was successfully extubated.  Her NG tube was also discontinued.
She was transferred to the floor and on postoperative days
12/10/6 the patient was started on sips.  She was seen by
physical therapy, as well as continued on her TPN.  Her TPN was
discontinued on the following day, while the patient started
taking clears.  The patient was also seen by enterostomy therapy
to help in teaching.  She remained hemodynamically stable, was
passing stool through her ostomy bag, had a well healing
incision, and was tolerating a regular diet, and was ready for
discharge on post operative day 14/12/8, with a 1 week course of
cipro flagyl to be completed per the Infectious disease team.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2103-11-12**] and taken to the operating
room for takedown of her ileostomy and ileocolic anastomosis.
She tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss and was
transferred to the PACU and then the floor.  While on the floor
she began having fevers and tachycardia on POD 1.  Blood
cultures were sent with one bottle out of four returning
positive for MRSA.  She was transferred to the ICU for closer
monitoring and fluid resucitation.  She recovered three days
later with respect to her tachycardia and was afebrile after 3
days of vancomycin.  Back on the floor she was found to have an
ileus with abdominal distension.  We placed an NGT for
decompression and kept her NPO.  On POD 7 she was started on
clears and was advanced to a regular diet over the next two
days.  We noted that her surgical wound was draining some
serosanguinous fluid, so we opened up 3-4 staples and packed the
wound with a wet to dry dressing.  She was discharged with VNA
for care of this wound as well as her ileostomy wounds on POD
10.

206,5239,129387,2189-02-25,,,Discharge summary,Report,,,Admission Date:  [**2189-2-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2189-2-25**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 83-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension,
chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and history of a
gastrointestinal bleed, who presented to the Emergency
Department at [**Hospital1 69**] at 8 A.M.
with epigastric pain.  The patient's pain started at
approximately 7:30 A.M. on the day of admission after eating
breakfast.  It was described as a burning sensation.  The
patient took one sublingual nitroglycerin without effect.
The patient reportedly denied any shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or headache.  The patient
had been off her aspirin and Plavix secondary to a
gastrointestinal bleed in [**2188-12-26**], requiring
hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1196**].

Electrocardiogram obtained in the Emergency Department showed
upsloping ST segments and was initially interpreted as
J-point elevation.  Subsequently at 1 P.M., the patient's
systolic blood pressures decreased to the 40s and repeat
electrocardiogram at that time revealed bigeminy with ST
elevations of 5 mm in V2 through V4.  Cardiology team was
consulted, and the patient brought emergently to the
catheterization laboratory with systolic blood pressures in
the 80s.

In the catheterization laboratory, the patient's blood
pressure was marginal, with pressures between 70s and 80s
systolic, and dopamine drip was started.  Initial angiogram
showed significant left anterior descending obstruction.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  The patient was then
electively intubated, as oxygen saturations were decreasing
on non-rebreather mask.  Arterial blood gas as that time was
a pH of 7.16, pCO2 of 51, and pO2 of 51.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post left anterior
descending stent and percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to diagonal I and obtuse marginal I on [**2188-11-28**]
2.  Congestive heart failure
3.  Hypertension
4.  Chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia
5.  History of a gastrointestinal bleed, recently discharged
from the hospital on [**2189-2-10**]

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg by mouth
once daily held since [**2-10**], Plavix 75 mg by mouth once
daily held since [**2-14**], Synthroid 25 mcg by mouth once
daily, Zestril 5 mg by mouth once daily, Lopressor 50 mg by
mouth twice a day, folate 1 mg by mouth once daily, Protonix
40 mg by mouth once daily, Timoptic one drop to each eye once
daily, Xalatan one drop to each eye once daily, prednisone 30
mg by mouth once daily

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs:  Temperature 98.8, blood
pressure 88/42, heart rate 122, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 100% on 50% FIO2.  In general, the patient is an
elderly white female, sedated and intubated.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm, positive S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops or
rubs.  Lungs:  Bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, right groin PA
catheter and arterial line in place, left groin intra-aortic
balloon pump in place.

LABORATORY DATA:   White blood cells 14.2, hematocrit 31.8,
platelets 283.  Differential:  Neutrophils 97%, lymphs 3%.
Sodium 142, potassium 3.4, chloride 106, bicarbonate 24, BUN
23, creatinine 0.8, glucose 101.  INR 1.1, PTT 20.6, PT 12.7.
CK at 10 A.M. on [**2-18**] of 46, at 2 P.M. 475, with an MB of
60 and an MB index of 12.6 and a troponin of 40.9.
Urinalysis was benign.  Chest x-ray showed heart size within
normal limits, a prominent pulmonary vasculature was noted,
bilateral interstitial opacities were noted.
Electrocardiogram at 8:47 A.M. showed sinus at 87 beats per
minute, left axis deviation with left ventricular
hypertrophy, 1 to [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in V1, upsloping ST
elevations in V2 and V3, no ST depressions or Qs.
Electrocardiogram at 1:05 P.M. with decreased blood pressure
showed bigeminy at 96 beats per minute, [**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations in
V2 and V3, 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V4 and V5, ST
depressions in II, III and AVF, Q waves developed in V2
through V5, with loss of R wave progression.  Cardiac
catheterization from [**2189-2-18**], had the following
findings:  Left dominant system with three vessel coronary
artery disease, the left main coronary artery was normal, the
left anterior descending was totally occluded at the site of
the previously-placed proximal stent, the ramus intermedius
branch had a long tubular 80% stenosis, the left circumflex
artery had a 50% proximal stenosis, the first obtuse marginal
branch was totally occluded, and the second obtuse marginal
branch had a 70% origin stenosis, the left posterior
descending artery had a mild luminal irregularity, the right
coronary artery was a small non-dominant vessel and had an
80% proximal stenosis.  Successful percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending
in-stent lesion, and successful percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stenting of the ramus intermedius
branch.  Hemodynamic measurements performed after the
coronary intervention with the patient intubated requiring
intravenous inotropic support with intra-aortic balloon pump
in the left femoral artery revealed elevated left-sided
filling pressures.  The wedge pressure was 21 mm Hg.  The
cardiac index was marginally decreased at 2.1.  As above, an
intra-aortic balloon pump was introduced into the left
femoral artery.

IMPRESSION:   82-year-old female with previous coronary
artery disease status post recent left anterior descending
stent, Class II congestive heart failure, hypertension,
history of recent gastrointestinal bleed, presents with acute
ST elevation, anteroseptal and anterior wall myocardial
infarction.  Taken to the catheterization laboratory for
intervention and admitted to the Coronary Care Unit,
intubated, with an intra-aortic balloon pump in place, as
well as on a dopamine drip secondary to hypotension.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Cardiac:
a.  Ischemia:  As above, patient with proximal left anterior
descending stent in-stent re-stenosis as well as significant
occlusion to the ramus intermedius status post intervention.
The patient was started on aspirin and Plavix
post-intervention.  Peak CK was noted to be 71 to 85, which
was on [**2189-2-18**], which gradually trended down to a
value of 113 on the day of admission.  In addition, the
patient was started on an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker once
blood pressure could tolerate.

b.  Pump:  As above, patient noted to be in cardiogenic shock
with increased wedge and decreased systolic blood pressure.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the catheterization
laboratory.  The patient was also given lasix x 1 in the
catheterization laboratory for elevated wedge pressure, and
diuresed well with this one-time dose.  No additional lasix
doses were given on hospital day number one, and greater
attention was paid to improving hemodynamics with pressor and
inotropic agents.  The patient was initially transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit on a dopamine drip, however, was noted
to be markedly tachycardic to as high as 130s to 140s in
sinus rhythm.  The decision was made to discontinue the
dopamine and start milrinone for inotropic effect and
Levophed for pressor support.  The patient's blood pressure
was titrated to greater than 60, and the patient's heart rate
subsequently was better controlled in the 80s to 90s.
Subsequently, with improved hemodynamics, decision was made
to remove the intra-aortic balloon pump on hospital day
number three.  In addition, on the following day, the
patient's milrinone and Levophed drips were discontinued as
the patient was maintaining adequate hemodynamics on her own.
Lastly, a decision of whether the patient should be long-term
anticoagulated in light of her recent anterior wall event was
to be evaluated with an echocardiogram.  Decision to
anticoagulate long-term will be weighed against the possible
risks in light of underlying gastrointestinal pathology and a
history of a recent gastrointestinal bleed.

c.  Rhythm:  Patient noted to have a sinus tachycardia on
arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, on a dopamine drip.
Subsequently was switched to milrinone and Levophed drips.
The patient's sinus tachycardia improved to normal sinus
rhythm with occasional episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia, which was thought secondary to reperfusion.

2.  Pulmonary:  Patient noted to be hypercarbia and hypoxic
in the catheterization laboratory on a non-rebreather, and
decision for intubation was made.  The patient was maintained
on assist control on arrival to the Coronary Care Unit, and
subsequently was weaned with successful extubation on
hospital day number three.

3.  Hematology:  Patient with a history of chronic anemia
secondary to chronic autoimmune hemolytic etiology,
maintained on prednisone as an outpatient.  In light of
recent events, the patient was placed on stress dose steroids
through the intravenous, which was subsequently changed to
oral prednisone.  The patient received two to three units of
packed red blood cells while in the Coronary Care Unit
secondary to a slightly decreased hematocrit, which was
thought secondary to her underlying chronic condition as well
as possibly secondary to her gastrointestinal bleed in light
of some coffee-ground emesis.  The patient's hematocrit
remained relatively stable during her hospital stay, with a
range of 28 to 33.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  As above, patient with a history of a
gastrointestinal bleed with one to two episodes of
coffee-ground emesis while in the Coronary Care Unit.  Coffee
grounds then cleared, and the patient was maintained on
Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice a day.  As above, the
patient's hematocrit remained stable for the most part during
her hospital stay, and she remained hemodynamically stable,
and there was no need for Gastroenterology consult during
this hospital stay.

5.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine status post cardiac
catheterization remained at her baseline, and there were no
acute renal issues while an inpatient at [**Hospital1 346**].

6.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Patient's
electrolytes were monitored closely, with adequate repletion,
especially in light of some ventricular ectopy noted on
telemetry.  Initially nothing by mouth secondary to
intubation, and the patient was started on low-dose tube
feeds at 10 cc/hour, ProMod with fiber.  Upon extubation,
tube feeds were discontinued, and the patient was advanced to
an oral diet without complications.

This has been a dictation detailing the hospital events from
[**2189-2-18**], to [**2189-2-22**].  Addendum to follow
detailing the rest of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course,
including a list of discharge diagnoses, discharge
medications, and plan for discharge and follow up.

Service:  CCU

Please note that this interval dictation takes up on [**2189-2-23**], where the dictation of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**] [**Name (STitle) **] previously
dictated left off.

ADDITIONAL HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from
the Coronary Care Unit to the floor at approximately 3 A.M.
on [**2-23**], without event.  At approximately 9 A.M., the
patient began to complain of shortness of breath and was
found to be tachycardic to the 150s after walking a distance
to the bathroom.  The patient's electrocardiogram
demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST elevations in Leads V2
and V3, otherwise the electrocardiogram was unchanged.  On
examination, the patient had a blood pressure of 146/60,
pulse of 135, pulse oxygenation 98% on 2 liters, was
diffusely wheezy on respiratory examination, and was markedly
diaphoretic, without jugular venous distention or edema.  The
patient was given several doses of intravenous Lopressor, as
well as high-dose intravenous lasix.  The pulse oxygenation
transiently fell to 88% on 5 liters face mask, and an
arterial blood gas taken was 7.37/32/56.  A chest x-ray
demonstrated increased congestive heart failure and the
patient was given some nitro paste without effect, and then
begun on nitroglycerin drip as well as additional lasix 80 mg
intravenous push.

The patient rapidly thereafter clinically improved, with a
blood pressure falling from a high in the 170s/80s to 135/76,
with a normalization of respiratory rate and a pulse
oxygenation of 92 to 95% on 6 liters, as well as over a liter
of urine out ultimately, and a clearing of previous wheezing
on examination.

The patient was again cycled with cardiac enzymes, which
revealed a troponin elevated greater than the measurable
range, likely from the prior cardiac events that were
described in Dr.[**Name (NI) 2056**] dictation.  However, repeated
measurements of creatine kinase failed to demonstrate an
elevation in that enzyme, and rather demonstrated a continued
trend down.  The patient was begun on standing lasix
initially at 40 mg once daily, which was then increased to 40
mg twice a day, and then to 80 mg by mouth twice a day.  The
thought being that the patient had been approximately 4
liters positive during this admission, and that the
above-described events likely represented worsening
congestive heart failure/pulmonary edema in the setting of
volume overload.  Additionally, the patient's blood pressure
was better controlled with Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three
times a day, and the patient's Lopressor dose as well was
increased to 50 mg by mouth three times a day with good
effect on the patient's cardiac rate.

The patient's hematocrit continued to be stable for the
remainder of this admission.  She had no further respiratory
difficulties, and was seen by Physical Therapy, who suggested
inpatient therapy to improve the patient's endurance.

The patient was sent for echocardiography, which demonstrated
an ejection fraction between 20 and 25%, with multiple wall
motion abnormalities as described.  In discussion with the
Cardiology team, the decision was made not to anticoagulate
the patient at this time, given her recent history of
significant clinical gastrointestinal bleeding.  In
consultation with the patient's attending cardiologist,
decision was made to discharge the patient to rehabilitation
on [**2189-2-25**].

Please note that during the sequence described for [**2-23**],
the patient's electrocardiogram appeared to show sinus
tachycardia with the above-stated ST elevations in V2 and V3,
which did resolve with the patient's tachycardia.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The patient was sent for echocardiography
on [**2-24**], with the following findings:  Symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with extensive regional systolic
dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease,
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, moderate mitral
regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation.  The left
ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be between 20
and 25%.  Left ventricular wall motion was noted in detailed
report to have abnormalities in the basal anterior portion,
which was hypokinetic, mild mid-anterior which was akinetic,
basilar and anteroseptal which was akinetic, mid-anteroseptal
which was akinetic, basal inferoseptal which was hypokinetic,
mid-inferoseptal which was hypokinetic, anterior apex which
was akinetic, septal apex which was akinetic, inferior apex
which was akinetic, lateral apex which was akinetic, and apex
which was dyskinetic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Lasix 80 mg by mouth twice a day,
Captopril 12.5 mg by mouth three times a day, Ambien 5 mg by
mouth daily at bedtime as needed, Prevacid 30 mg by mouth
twice a day, Timoptic 5% one drop to both eyes once daily,
Xalatan one drop to both eyes once daily, NPH four units
subcutaneously twice a day, regular insulin sliding scale,
folate 1 mg by mouth once daily, Synthroid 25 mcg by mouth
once daily, Plavix 75 mg by mouth once daily for 25 days (to
complete a one month course), Lopressor 50 mg by mouth three
times a day and hold for systolic blood pressure less than or
equal to 100 or pulse less than or equal to 60), aspirin 81
mg by mouth once daily, levofloxacin 250 mg by mouth once
daily for five days (to complete a ten day course),
prednisone 50 mg by mouth once daily for four days then
prednisone 40 mg by mouth once daily for four days then
prednisone 30 mg by mouth once daily (this is the patient's
baseline prednisone dose for her autoimmune hemolytic
anemia).

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post myocardial infarction
2.  Congestive heart failure
3.  Hypertension
4.  Chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia
5.  Gastrointestinal bleeding

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient will be discharged to
rehabilitation.  She is to follow up with her primary care
physician and cardiologist within one week of discharge from
rehabilitation, as well as with her primary
hematologist/oncologist or other physician for follow up of
chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia.  The patient will be
continued on finger stick blood glucoses four times a day
with regular insulin sliding scale as described.  It is
suggested that the patient's electrolytes be measured every
other day and repleted as necessary.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

Service:  CCU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
woman with a history of coronary artery disease with recent
CCU stay and autoimmune hemolytic anemia who presented again
to the CCU after being admitted to the floor with a two-day
history of weakness, increased shortness of breath, decreased

She had stent to the left anterior descending at an outside
hospital in [**2188-11-25**].  She then represented to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2189-2-18**], with her
anginal equivalent (epigastric pain) and was found to have ST
elevations on her electrocardiogram in leads V2-V5.  She had
a complicated emergent catheterization.  The catheterization
placed on Dopamine and intubated.

On catheterization, the patient had in stent restenosis of
the left anterior descending, and she received percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty.  A lesion of the ramus
intermedius was stented as well.  Intra-aortic balloon pump
was initiated at that time.

She had a four-day stay in the CCU when she was able to be
taken off the balloon pump and ventilatory support.  She did
have an episode of acute hypoxia after transfer to the floor
that improved with diuresis and nitrates.  She was discharged
two weeks to this current admission to a nursing home.

On presentation to the Emergency Department the patient had a
heart rate of around 100, and systolic blood pressure in the
80-90s.  Hematocrit was down to 24.5.  Hematocrit on
discharge from her prior hospitalization was 33; however, her
baseline hematocrit is in the mid 20s.  She was transfused 1
U of packed red blood cells in the Emergency Department.  She
had no electrocardiogram changes on arrival to the Emergency
Department.

Upon arrival to the floor, she had acute decrease in oxygen
saturations to the low 80s with tachypnea and tachycardia to
the 150s.  She was given intravenous Nitroglycerin drip,
intravenous Lasix, and intravenous Lopressor 2.5 mg, as well
as IV Morphine 2 mg.  Her ABG showed a pH of 7.19, and a pCO2
of 48, and a pO2 of 56.  The patient was intubated and
transferred to the CCU.  Her electrocardiogram showed sinus
tachycardia with unchanged segment elevations in V2-V4
compared with baseline.  Her chest x-ray was consistent with
increasing congestive heart failure compared with earlier in
the day.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction in [**2189-1-23**].  Catheterization in
[**2188-11-25**] with stent to the proximal to the left anterior
descending, and PTCA to the ramus and diagonal, 80% proximal
right coronary artery lesion.  Catheterization in [**2189-1-23**]
showed 100% proximal left anterior descending in stent
stenosis, and PTCA was performed, as well as 100% OM1 lesion,
as well as an 80% ramus lesion which was stented.
Catheterization was complicated by hypotension and
respiratory distress as described in the HPI.  2.  Systolic
dysfunction a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20-25% by
echocardiogram earlier this month showing mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy as well.  Echocardiogram also showed
near akinesis of the entire septum and anterior wall of the
left ventricle, as well as distal inferior and distal lateral
wall akinesis.  The apex was aneurysmal as well.  3.
Hypertension.  4.  History of GI bleed.  The patient had an
admission during [**2189-1-23**] for GI bleed.  5.  Autoimmune
hemolytic anemia followed by Hematology/Oncology at [**Hospital6 1760**] diagnosed in [**2188-11-25**].
6.  Diabetes mellitus thought to be steroid induced.  7.
Hypothyroidism.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., Captopril
12.5 mg t.i.d., Ambien 5 mg q.h.s., Prevacid 30 mg b.i.d.,
Timoptic 0.5% eye drops, Xalatan eyedrops, NPH Insulin 4 U

q.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d., Lopressor 50 mg t.i.d., Aspirin 81
mg q.d., Prednisone taper currently at 30 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient resides at [**Hospital 582**] Nursing Home.
Denies tobacco.  Occasional alcohol.  She is a retired hair
dresser.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  On admission temperature
was 100.0??????, heart rate 100, blood pressure 118/51, oxygen
saturation 100% on 60% FIO2 on vent setting AC 12 x 550 FIO2
60% .............. to 7.5.  General:  The patient was
intubated, awake, responsive.  The patient was in no acute
distress.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  No
murmurs.  Audible over breath sounds.  Respirations:  Diffuse
anterior crackles.  Extremities:  Trace bilateral lower
extremity edema.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds.  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Guaiac negative in the Emergency
Department.  Neck:  There was 9 cm JVP.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 12.4, hematocrit 29.4 up from
24.5 in the Emergency Department, platelet count 290; INR
1.1, PTT 23.4; potassium 3.4, BUN 28, creatinine 1.4, glucose
172, magnesium 1.7, albumin 3.1; CKs serially 41, 36, 39,
troponin 1.3 on the morning of admission.

ASSESSMENT:  This was an 83-year-old woman with known
congestive heart failure and ischemic coronary disease
presenting flash pulmonary edema in the setting of blood
transfusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular/ischemia:  The patient
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization while intubated.
The catheterization showed instant restenosis of her left
anterior descending stent at 40%; however, distal to the
stent, there was an 80% focal lesion which was ballooned and
stented.  Her ramus stent were patent with associated ostial 40%
lesion.  Her known 80% right coronary artery lesion remained
unchanged.  Right heart catheterization showed a pulmonary wedge
pressure of 30, RA pressure of 12, PA pressure of 61/34, RV
pressure of 61/16. Cardiac output was 4.4 with an index of 2.9.
Mixed venous saturation in the Catheterization Lab was 57.6 from
the pulmonary artery.

The patient did well postcatheterization and was able to be
extubated.  She was placed on Aspirin and Plavix for life.
Beta-blocker was re-added, and Lopressor was titrated up 50
mg b.i.d.  Ace inhibitor was also added.  Her statin was
continued as well.  She remained chest-pain free and free of
shortness of breath throughout the rest of her
hospitalization.

2.  Cardiovascular/pump:  The patient's ejection fraction was
known to be 20%.  Heart catheterization confirmed her fluid
overload and congestive heart failure physiology.  She did
not respond to Lasix on initially arriving in the CCU;
however after catheterization, she diuresed well to Lasix
with general improvement in her PA diastolics and improvement
of her kidney function.  She was able to be extubated without
difficulty after adequate diuresis was achieved.

Upon arrival to the floor from the CCU, the CHF Service was
consulted.  They recommended initiating Digoxin, low-dose
nitrate, and standing p.o. Lasix which was done.  She was
discharged with plans to follow-up with the CHF Service for
continued medical management of her congestive heart failure.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient was able to be initially
extubated on the second hospital day; however, on the day
after initial extubation, her status remained tenuous with
increasing Nitroglycerin drip and p.r.n. Morphine required to
reduce her preload enough to maintain oxygenation.  On the
night after initial extubation, she required emergent
reintubation due to acute hypoxia.  Chest x-ray prior to
intubation demonstrated white-out of the lower two-thirds of
the right lung; however, film 3-4 hours postintubation showed
resolution of the opacity throughout the right lung
consistent with acute mucous plugging.  It was therefore
thought that that episode of hypoxia was not due to
congestive heart failure but to mucous plugging.  The patient
was reextubated without difficulty status post
catheterization and maintained satisfactory oxygenation
throughout the remainder of her hospital stay.

She was also started on Levofloxacin on admission due to
suspicion of right upper lobe infiltrate.  Levofloxacin was
switched to Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin on the third
hospital day.  She remained afebrile throughout her hospital
course but did however start to develop a cough toward the
end of her hospital stay.  She was continued on the
Ceftriaxone through the hospital stay with the plan for a
total 14-day course along with her Azithromycin.

4.  Infectious disease:  As above, the patient was treated
for suspicion of pneumonia.  Of note, she had an isolated
positive blood culture growing gram-positive cocci in pairs
and clusters from [**2189-3-19**]; however, she was afebrile
throughout the time surrounding this culture.  Repeat
cultures were drawn on [**2189-3-24**], and were pending at
the time of this dictation.

5.  Heme:  The patient has a history of autoimmune hemolytic
anemia with a baseline hematocrit in the mid 20s.  As noted
in the HPI, she was transfused 1 U prior to her episode of
flash pulmonary edema.  Hematology Service was [**Name (NI) 653**], and
they felt that it would be acceptable to transfuse the
patient as needed.  The patient was transfused with one
additional unit of blood during her hospital stay.  Due to
her steroids and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, she was
restarted on stress dose steroids as she had been on her
previous admission.  These were quickly tapered to a
discharge dose of Prednisone 10 mg q.d.  The patient had
stable blood pressure and hematocrit on this dose.

6.  Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient
developed hypernatremia toward the end of her hospital stay
with a peak sodium of 151.  It was thought that this was due
to inadequate p.o. intake and free-water intake, and she was
encouraged to maintain p.o. intake.  A Nutrition consult was
obtained as well.  Follow-up labs of her sodium were pending
at the time of this dictation.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to acute
rehabilitation in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o.
q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., Timoptic 0.5% eye drops 1 drop
per eye q.d., Xalatan 0.005% solution 1 drop to each eye
q.d., Folate 1 mg p.o. q.d., NPH Insulin 4 U subcue b.i.d.,
Synthroid 250 mcg p.o. q.d., Azithromycin 250 mg p.o. q.d.,
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Prednisone 10 mg q.d., Ceftriaxone
1 g IV q.24 hours to be discontinued on [**4-1**], Lopressor 50
mg p.o. q.d., Onalopril b.i.d., Ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
p.r.n., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d., Digoxin
0.125 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post new stent to the left
anterior descending.
2.  Congestive heart failure complicated by flash pulmonary
edema requiring intubation.
3.  Pneumonia.
4.  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2072**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for ACS.

1. CAD/ACS. OSH reported ECG with ST depressions in
V2-V5/Elevation in III and negative CE??????s. Admitted with ACS and
sent directly to cath. TNTs drawn post cath and positive, but
trended down ([**12-20**] PCI?). CK??????s were flat. Thus, was unclear where
to place pt on spectrum of UA --> STEMI. Card Cath revealed: R
dom. 3VD. LMCA widely patent. LAD 50% at ostium. LCX 70% mid
lesion (before OM1. RCA long 70% lesion (before bifurcation off
the PDA and posterolateral branch). RCA Drug-Eluting Stent was
placed and it was deemed the patient should be evaluated for
CABG at a future date. Of note, after cath, the patient was
extremely sleepy and had RR of 8. He was sent to the ICU for
monitoring, but was lucid and stable within 8-10 hrs. His
sleepiness was attributed to the large amount of sedatives,
opioids that he received at the OSH and intracath. He was not
given Narcan. He was stable and CP free for the remainder of his
admission. Continuous telemetry monitoring revealed SR
(50s-70s). Pt was continued on Atorvastatin 80 mg PO QD (incr
from 40), Clopidogrel Bisulfate 75 mg PO QD, Lisinopril 20 mg PO
QD (incr from 10mg), Aspirin EC 325 mg PO QD. Diltiazem was
DCed. Outpatient ECHO was recommended to eval for any HK
segments.

2. HTN. SBPs 90s-120s. Continued on meds as above plus
Isosorbide Mononitrate (Extended Release) 30 mg PO QD. SBPs in
90s were likely related to opioid admin.

3. GERD. Continue Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H. No symptoms now.

4. FEN. Cards healthy diet.

5. PPx. Colace/Senna. SubQ Hep.

6. Dispo. DCed to home after being cleared by PT.

complicated by chronic kidney disease (stage IV), EF of 25-30%,
obesity, and
tobacco abuse.  He presented today to the emergency room after
[**Hospital 2081**] clinic noted severe bilateral papilledema; opthomology
suggested this was secondary to either elevated intracranial
pressure in the setting of malignant hypertension or pseudotumor
cerebri.  He has been symptomatic with blurry vision over the
past month in the absence of headaches or other central
symptoms.  He has noted some gait instability. In the ED, his
blood pressure was noted to be 180/118.  He took his usual dose
of one of his blood pressure meds (unknown) and his BP improved
to 160 systolic.  He was transferred to the MICU for management
of hypertensive emergency.

IMAGING:

CT Head w/o contrast [**2159-4-6**]:
1. No acute intracranial pathology.
2. Bilateral proptosis.

renal u/s [**2159-4-9**]:
Both kidneys show increased echogenicity consistent with chronic

kidney disease. Two simple cysts in the right kidney, one at the
upper pole and one at the lower pole. Doppler evaluation of both
renal arteries and of the arcuate/segmental vessels in the renal
parenchyma was within normal limits. No ultrasound/Doppler
evidence for renal artery stenosis.

tte [**2159-4-10**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Hypertensive Emergency:  Pt presented with HTN systolics >200
and blurry vision, found to have papilledema. The patient's
blood pressure was markedly elevated with systolic blood
pressures ranging from 160-210 during ICU stay.  Review of prior
notes outlines a longstanding history of poorly controlled blood
pressures.  His home isosorbide and carvedilol were
discontinued. Labetalol was uptitrated to 200mg TID, Hydral
downtitrated to 50mg TID, clonidine 0.3mg weekly patch started,
and furosemide/metolazone continued as is. MAP >120 was goal. On
leaving the ICU SPB was in 130s. TSH was within normal limits.
It was felt that this patient needed a full workup for secondary
causes of hypertension. In the meantime renal artery ultrasound
done here showed no renal artery stenosis but did show chornic
bilateral changes consistent with CKDD. He should likely have a
workup for hyperaldosteronism (see hypokalemia below) and workup
including urine metanephrines and dexamethasone suppression
test, as he is quite young for this degree of hypertension and
seems to be compliant with his medications. He was initially
started on spironolactone given report of EF 25-30% and thought
that it may help with hypokalemia, however after 3 days (3
doses) this was discontinued so that pt could ideally have a
renin/aldosterone level drawn prior to discharge (which is now
pending), several days after discontinuation. Would recommend
restarting this medication after the appropriate studies have
been done. It is more than likely this patient has sleep apnea
as well; in the ICU he was noted to have desats during sleep
with very loud snoring. Desats resolved instantly on waking. Pt
is also smoking and quite obese both of which are likely
worsening his hypertension. Would recommend outpatient sleep
study as well.
.
#hypokalemia - pt was noted to be hypokalemic with potassium
2.9-3.2. Concern for hyperaldosterone state given concommittant
resistant hypertension. Pt required >160meq potassium repletion
per day while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and still remained with K below 4.0.
Outpatient records demonstrate history of low potassium. Pt also
had been started on spironolactone, and while it was low dose,
it did not appear to help with potassium retention. This was
also unusual in the setting of elevated creatinine/chronic renal
failure, which emphasized concerns for hyperaldosterone state.
Spironolactone was DCd temporarily so that he could have
renin/[**Male First Name (un) 2083**] levels drawn.

#Intracranial hypertension: Likely secondary to systmemic
hypertension.  Neurology evalauted patient in ED and suggested
potential LP if BP controlled to assess for pseudotumor
cerebrii, though this can be deferred to outpatient setting if
papilledema does not improve with improved BP control.
.
#Chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine was elevated
at 3.6-3.7, which is baseline. CKD likely secondary to
hypertensive nephropathy.  Continued sevalamer and nephrocaps.
.
#Chronic systolic CHF: No echo in the system, but OSH records
per Dr.[**Name (NI) 2084**] note states TTE showed increased wall
thickness, estimated LVEF 25-30% and global hypokinesis without
focal wall motion abnormality, as well as increased [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**], with estimated PA systolic pressure 32mm.  The
patient appeared euvolemic on exam, without evidence of an acute
sCHF exacerbation.  His blood pressure control was adjusted as
above, including the addition of spironolactone to his regimen.
Despite his renal impairment, he may benefit from the addition
of an ACEi/[**Last Name (un) **] and should discuss this with his PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2085**], and nephrologist.  He was continued on a beta
blocker (though switched from metoprolol/carvedilol to
labetalol), lasix, and metolazone. His EF on the TTE here showed
an EF of 55%.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Has PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2086**], and nephrology follow-up scheduled
-Needs outpatient sleep study
-Would benefit from work-up for secondary hypertension if not
already done at another facility - follow up renin/[**Male First Name (un) 2083**] ratio,
may draw urine metaneprhines, dex suppression testing
-Patient was a Full Code during this admission
-Would benefit from nutrition consult
- Has Cr and K ordered as outpt on Thursday which needs f/up

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 2087**],

You were admitted to the intensive care unit at [**Hospital1 771**] with very high blood pressures and
blurry vision.  Your blurry vision was likely caused by your
high blood pressure.  When your blood pressure is this high, you
are at risk for serious complications including further kidney
damage and possible stroke.  We monitored you closely and
changed some of your blood pressure medications to help better
control your blood pressures.

We made the following changes to your medications:
STOPPED:
-Carvedilol
-Metoprolol
-Isosorbide mononitrate

DECREASED:
-Hydralazine from 100 mg three times a day to 50 mg three times
a day

INCREASED:
-Potassium chloride 20 meq chrystals increased from one dose
once a day to two doses once a day

STARTED:
-Clonidine patch 0.3 mg once a week
-Labetalol 400 mg three times a day
-Lisinopril 2.5mg once a day

We did not make any other changes to your medications.  Please
continue to take them as you have been doing.

It is very important that you take your blood pressure
medications and monitor your blood pressure.  If your blood
pressure is persistently higher than 190/110, you should contact
your doctor.  Also, if you develop any worsening blurry vision,
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, slurred speech, or
weakness on one side of the face or body, you should seek
medical attention immediately.

We are concerned you may have a condition called obstructive
sleep apnea, and we recommend you have a sleep study after you
leave the hospital.

We also recommend that you see a nutritionist and work on
continuing to lose weight.  Please eat a low salt diet.

We also strongly encourage you to stop smoking.

Please also note that you will need to get your creatinine and
potassium checked on Thursday, [**2159-4-12**].

Chief Complaint:
Xanax, Tylenol & Klonopin Overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
37 yo F with history of depression and suicidal attempt in the
past presented with obtundation.  Of note, her prior attempt was
about 15 years ago during which she OD on theophylline,
requiring intubation.  She has been feeling more depressed over
the last few months and has been seeing a therapist, on the ECT
waiting list with recent evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2109**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her
partner.  [**Name (NI) **] reports taking 120 mg of Xanax and 80 mg
Klonopin in the afternoon of [**2101-10-25**] as well as at least [**4-7**]
g of Tylenol daily over the last 2 weeks.  She also admitted to
taking 20 mg of Ambien.  She says that she was taking the
tylenol intentionally to worsen her liver function.  She says
that she decided to do this because she wanted to commit
suicide.  She also reports having had 1 glass of wine on the day
of these medication ingestions.  She then called one of her
friends afterwards, and her therapist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2110**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) was
subsequently involved and called the EMS for patient.

In the ED, her initial VS were HR 99, BP 102/56, RR 20, and 98%
on RA.  She arrived with her friend, very lethargic.  Per
report, was only responsive to sternal rub and GCS of 8
throughout.  Tox screen showed positive benzos and acetaminophen
only.  ECG showed sinus tachycardia.  UA was negative.  CT head
did not show ICH.  Her initial Tylenol level was 40.  Toxicology
was consulted and recommended NAC for 21 hours until level is
undetectable and LFT stabilizes.  She started NAC in the ED and
her repeat level was 29.  VS prior to transfer were T95, HR 66,
BP 121/73, RR 22, O2Sat 98% RA.

She was transferred to the ICU for her poor mental status.
While on the floor, appears comfortable, denies any SOB, chest
pain/discomfort, abdominal pain/discomfort, urinary symptoms or
URI symptoms.  She does have some throat tightness and
discomfort when swallowing.  Her partner reports that patient's
mental status seems to have improved since her initial arrival
to the ED.


Past Medical History:
- Asthma, requiring 1x intubation in late teen (unclear if this
was related to the theophylline)
- GERD with severe esophagitis ([**2098**])
- Insomnia
- Bipolar Type 2, currently severe depression, requiring
hospitalization at [**Doctor First Name **] in the past

of suicidal attempts presents with OD of benzodiazepine and
Tylenol

Medicaion Overdose, an attempt to suicide.   The patient was
treated supportively for benzodiazepine overdose and did not
require mechanical ventilation.  In regards to tylenol toxicity
she required a N acetylcysteine drip for a tylenol level of 40
and normal liver function tests, after stopping the NAC drip her
tylenol level was negative and LFTs remained normal.  She was
medically cleared for discharge to a psyhiatric inpatient
facility as of the a.m. of [**2101-10-27**], she is also medically
cleared for ECT.  In regards to her bipolar disorder and suicide
attempt psychiatry was consulted and suggested the following

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease now with
bradycardia.  He had an episode of dizziness when walking
today.  His wife took his pulse and noticed it was "slow."
The patient reportedly had some relief from his symptoms
after his wife gave him a sublingual nitroglycerin.  He
subsequently had a second episode of dizziness at rest and
went to the Emergency Department.

There, he was found to have a pulse of 30 without P waves.
External pacing was attempted and unsuccessful capturing.
Atropine was given without effect.  He was started on
dopamine 10 mcg per minute and noted to revert to sinus at 50
beats per minute then hypertension to the 200s.

The patient was reportedly still complaining of dizziness
while in sinus.  He denied chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, and palpitations.

He had an exercise treadmill test on [**2181-1-5**] which
was stopped for shortness of breath with no ST segment
changes.  Rhythm was sinus with rare isolated AEA and VEA
with blood pressure responsive flat.  Nuclear images with
moderate defects, apex with ejection fraction of 65% and mild
apical hypokinesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery disease; in [**2179-5-27**] with 20% left
main coronary artery, a DV left anterior descending with
noncritical stenosis and widely patent stent in the proximal
segment.  First obtuse marginal with critical lesion.  Left
circumflex with mild luminal irregularities and 40% proximal
right coronary artery.  Mild diastolic function with ejection
fraction of 60% with a normal wall motion.
 2.  Hepatitis C virus.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Nocturia.
 5.  Osteoarthritis.
 6.  Ventral hernia.
 7.  Cholelithiasis; status post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.
 8.  Colon cancer; status post colectomy in [**2165**].
 9.  Positive purified protein derivative.
10.  Cervical degenerative joint disease.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atorvastatin p.o. q.d.
4.  Doxazosin p.o. q.h.s.
5.  Zoloxafed 200 p.m.
6.  Tolterodine 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Losartan 80 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Diphenhydramine 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.
9.  Glucosamine 500 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, his pulse was 35, blood pressure was 100/42,
respiratory rate was 22.  He was 91% on room air.  In
general, he was lying with the head of the bed at 20 degrees,
in no acute distress.  His pupils were equally round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular motions
were intact.  Oral mucous membranes were dry.  Jugular venous
distention was difficult to assess secondary to constant head
and oral movement.  He was bradycardic with a normal S1 and
S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His lungs were clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  His abdomen with a prominent
ventral hernia was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Normal
active bowel sounds.  His extremities showed 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally with no pitting edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 7.8, hematocrit was 42.6, and platelets were
180.  Prothrombin time was 12.9, partial thromboplastin time
was 24.2, INR was 1.1.  Sodium was 145, potassium was 5.1,
chloride was 109, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea nitrogen was
22, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was 115.  CK was
63.  Troponin was less than 0.3.  Calcium was 9.9, magnesium
was 1.9, phosphate was 5.2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed junctional
bradycardia at 36 beats per minute with left axis with waves
in III and aVF and inverted T waves in III with no ST segment
changes.

Electrocardiogram after dopamine showed a normal sinus rhythm
at 61 beats per minute, a left axis, high-normal P-R
interval, Q waves in III and aVF, T wave flattening in III,
and no ST segment changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit
as a percutaneous wire was unable to capture and v-pace.

His heart rate was maintained on dopamine.  His rhythm was
found to be an atrial exit block, likely the cause of his
dizziness.  He was evaluated by Electrophysiology and was
sent for pacemaker placement.

On the second night of admission he was complaining of
insomnia and was given Ambien and became very agitated.  At
that time, he pulled out his right internal jugular Cordis.
Two hours after replaced, he received 2 mg of intravenous
haloperidol for the confusion and seemed to calm down.  It
was thought to be secondary to the Ambien which was
discontinued.  He had no further episodes of hallucinations
or agitation at that time.

His creatinine improved with hydration to his baseline of
around 0.8.  He was maintained on his outpatient medications
for BPH and osteoarthritis.

He received a pacemaker on [**2182-1-21**] without
complications.  His hematocrit remained stable.  He had
received three doses of vancomycin perioperatively.  His beta
blocker and angiotensin receptor blocker were resumed as they
had previously been held while on dopamine and also with his
tendency for bradycardia.  These were resumed without issue.

The only complicating factor was he was slightly nauseated
with vomiting after returning from his procedure.  It was
thought this was likely due to the sedation.  He was given
antiemetics, and it resolved the following day when the
sedation wore off.

He was able to eat and ambulate without dizziness or concern.
Therefore, he was discharged home in good condition.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atorvastatin p.o. q.d.
4.  Doxazosin p.o. q.h.s.
5.  Zoloxafed 200 p.m.
6.  Tolterodine 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Losartan 80 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Diphenhydramine 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.
9.  Glucosamine 500 mg p.o. q.d.

Of note, it should be noted that the patient should not be
given Ambien as it causes agitation and delirium.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  He was to follow up with
the Electrophysiology Clinic.

History of Present Illness:
64 yo AA male with HIV/AIDS (VL: 570; CD4: 251 on [**11-27**]'[**48**]
currently treated with Combivir and Bactrim SS Mon, Wed, Fri for
ppx as well as a flu shot for [**2147**]-[**2148**]) and COPD on home oxygen
(FEV1/FVC: 34%; FEV1 26%; FVC: 77%) comes in with dyspnea for 6
days. The pt reports development of sob similar to his previous
episodes of COPD/PNA. 2-3days ago, he subsequently developed
cough productive of yellow-green sputum along with subjective
fevers, chills, and diaphoresis. He also developed some
pleuritic chest pain several days ago. The chest pain was
located in the left side of the chest below the nipple line and
occurred with deep inspiration. The pt reports these are all
similar to previous episodes of COPD exacerbation. The pt had
tried nebulizers Q4hours in addition to 2L NC one day PTA
without any improvement. The pt uses oxygen at home 40% of the
time, mostly when he is active. The pt noted inc. DOE even with
the oxygen prior to this episode. The pt does admit to one
episode of vomiting in the ED, which was thought to be secondary
to meds he received in the ED. The pt denies HA, abd pain,
diarrhea.


In the ED, the pt was febrile to 101 rectally, requiring 5liters
oxygen to keep sats >96%. He was given ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, bactrim and solumedrol with continuouos nebs for
PNA vs. COPD flare. He had one episode of emesis in ED. The pt
also received a CTA which ruled out a PE (given the concern for
pleuritic chest pain). ABG in the ED was: 7.44/40/81-->
7.49/40/67. The pt reports improvement in his sob after
receiving solumedrol and nebs in the ED.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2150**] is a 67M with HIV (Cd4 183, VL 96 copies/mL) and end
stage COPD on 3-4L home O2 with a FEV1 of 0.5 who presented to
the emergency room on [**2152-2-15**] with increased shortness of
breath. Three days prior to presentation he developed nasal
congestion and rhinorrhea which made it difficult for him to use
his supplemental oxygen at home. He had subjective fevers and
chills but did not check his temperature. He had minimal cough
productive of dark yellow sputum. He was feeling more short of
breath despite increasing oxygen use. He was concerned about
pneumonia and presented to the emergency room.
.
In the emergency room his initial vitals were T: 98.1 HR: 86 RR:
107/72 RR: 22 O2: 100% on RA. He had a chest xray which showed
significant hyperinflation but no acute cardiopulmonary process.
He received levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, duonebs, solumedrol 125
mg IV x 1 and aspirin 81 mg. He was initially admitted to the
floor.
.
While on the floor he was started on azithromycin, solumedrol
125 mg IV TID, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers. He did well
on hospital day 1 but overnight his shortness of breath
worsened. He had a repeat CXR which was similar to priors. He
had an ABG on a non-rebreather which was 7.37/57/207/34. He had
increased work of breathing and asked to be placed on "a machine
for breathing." He is transferred to the MICU for non-invasive
ventilatory support.
n the MICU he was intubated an an A-line was placed due to
increased
WOB. Blood pressure was elevated while in respiratory distress
and he was treated with hydralazine. He had one episode of
hypotension responsive to IVF. A right IJ central line placed.
ABG on [**2-18**] was 7.32/54/104. Methylprednisolone was decreased to
60mg IV BID. He was extubated on ICU day 3 and initially
appeared in stress but did well after small dose IV morphine.He
was transferred to the floor on ICU day 4. Prior to transfer he
reviewed his code status and decided to be DNR/DNI.
.
On the floor, he is doing relatively well. He reports he is
still somewhat short of breath but not in any distress. He
reports back pain secondary to old back injury. He will be
spending time with family and friends who are coming in from
around the country to see him. Reports lack of appetite but no
n/v. Denies F/C cough, chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 2150**] is a 67M with HIV (on HAART) and
end-stage COPD (on home O2), who presented [**2152-2-15**] with
worsening shortness of breath in the setting of likely [**Hospital 2170**]
transferred to MICU for worsening respiratory distress.
.
# End-stage COPD/Respiratory Distress: End-stage baseline COPD
(FEV1 20% predicted and on home O2). Admitted w likely COPD
exacerbation triggered by viral URI. Nasal complaints and
absence of infiltrate go against a bacterial PNA. MI and PE also
considered. Pt treated with nebulizers, steroids, azithromycin.
ABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis which appears
compensated. Pt oxygenated well on O2 by nasal canula, but
developed respiratory distress w accessory muscle use, tachypnea
and tachycardia, which required MICU transfer on [**2-17**] for
increasing respiratory distress.  He was subsequently intubated
that same night as his respiratory status continued to worsen.
He remained stable on the vent and was extubated without
complications on [**2-19**].  His respiratory status continued to be
stable post-extubation.  He was continued on azithromycin for a
three day course and continued on steroids.  He was then
transferred back to the medical floor the following day after
extubation with stable respiratory status.  Followed by Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 2171**].  On the floor his steroid regimen was kept as IV until
patient's SBO resolved.  With resolution of SBO patient was
transitioned to PO steroids.  Pt was discharged with a steroid
taper.  His last dose of Prednisone 10mg [**3-6**].
.
On the floor his dyspnea continued and he required 4-5 L of
nasal O2. He was evaluated by palliative care after he made the
decision to become DNR/DNI. Based on their recommendations he
was switched from ATC morphine to MS contin and ativan for
dyspnea related anxiety. He was noted to have mental status
changes including confusion, somnolence so MS contin was
discontinued with return to normal mentation. His respiratory
continued to improve with decrease in anxiety noted.  Patient's
pain was well controlled with liquid morphine, fentanyl patch,
and tylenol #3 as needed.
.
# HIV/AIDS: Patient on HAART with recent decrease in CD4 count
to below 200, hence on bactrim ppx. Followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**]. HAART
was temporarily discontinued in the setting of SBO with nausea
and vomiting. With resolution of SBO, HAART was restarted on
[**2152-2-29**].
.
#Small bowel obstruction: Patient developed acutely worsening
abdominal pain on the [**Hospital1 **] associated with nausea and vomiting.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a partial SBO. He was
made NPO and a nasogastric tube was placed.  Patient's nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal distention improved steadily.  His NGT
was clamped and eventually discontinued on [**2-28**] with advancement
of his diet to a regular diet.  He tolerated that well.
.
#Pneumonia: Patient was found to have a left lower lobe
pneumonia incidentally on chest xray evaluating PICC placement.
Labs at the time were remarkable for leukocytosis. He was
started on Zosyn and vancomycin for presumed Hospital associated
pneumonia.  Patient's vancomycin was stopped on [**2-27**].  He was
continued on Zosyn and then transitioned to PO levoquin on [**2-29**]
and discharged on this medication to complete an 8 day course of
antibiotics with last day of antibiotics to be [**2152-3-4**].
.
# Hypertension: Normotensive on admission, mild elevation in
blood pressures in the setting of respiratory distress.  Patient
was continued on his home dose of doxazosin while in house.
.
# GERD: Stable. Continued H2 blocker.
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit dropped slightly during hospital admission
from patient's baseline of 36 to 22.  Iron studies demonstrated
most likely anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia
coupled with dilutional effect of IV hydration and daily blood
draws as reasonable explanation of drop in hematocrit.  Patient
was always hemodynamically stable with no signs or symptoms of
active bleeding.  Patient was started on PO Iron.

History of Present Illness:
69 yo M h/o HIV, COPD presenting with shortness of breath and
"not feeling well." He was notably just admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] for a
COPD exacerbation [**Date range (1) 2178**]. During this admission he was noted to
have a tenuous respiratory status with poor air movement and was
briefly intubated for a few hours. He was started on steroids
with a slow taper and azithromycin. Since his discharge he did
not feel well and came to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.9 103 170/105 27 99% 3L. He was
noted to have poor air movement and given 125 mg IV solumedrol
and duonebs. BiPAP started, however patient vomited, so this was
stopped. He was given IV zofran and phenergan. ABG was
7.37/58/96, so once his nausea resolved, he was placed back on
BiPap. He was notably tachycardic to the 180s which was felt to
be afib vs. MAT. He was given 15 mg IV diltiazem and broke soon
after this. He was notably also given morphine and ativan. CXR
notable for hyperinflation. Vitalls prior to transfer:: 101
189/109 21 100% Bipap.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was taken off of BiPAP due
to significant nausea. He was given IV compazine and placed on
nasal cannula with saturations near 100%. He continues to feel
short of breath.

Chest X-Ray:
1. Hyperexpanded lungs consistent with known diagnosis of COPD.
2. Stable right calcified lymph node.
3. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle
with preserved systolic function. Small and hyperdynamic left
ventricle. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2148-9-24**], RV is now mildly dilated and appears
hypertrophied. The other findings are probably similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo M h/o HIV on HAART, COPD on home oxygen, and remote
history of left leg DVT p/w worsening dyspnea after recent
discharge from OSH for COPD.
.
# Dyspnea: Likely COPD exacerbation. Patient has history of
severe emphysema and bronchiectasis. FEV1: 20% in spirometry
[**2150**] c/w end stage disease.  Patient was intermittently treated
with BIPAP in ICU, however his oxygen saturation was good and he
often requested BIPAP for only short amounts of time prior to
removing BIPAP. Mr. [**Known lastname 2150**] was started on Methylprednisolone 125
mg IV Q6H for the first day of admission and then was
transitioned to prednisone 60 mg daily.  He will continue on a
slow prednisone taper.  He was also treated with a 5 day course
of levofloxacin 750 mg.  Patient was treated with duonebs and
received ativan and oxycodone for dyspnea.  He was started on
bactrim, famotidine, and calc/vit D for prophylaxis for presumed
long term steroids.
.
# Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Patient was noted to have
multifocal atrial tachycardia ED, resolved prior to admission to
ICU. Likley secondary to underlying COPD.  Patient's COPD was
controlled and he did not have multifocal atrial tachycardia
while in ICU.  Diltiazem was started at 30mg TID for HR control
with HRs < 100.
.
# HTN: Patient with elevated SBPs.  He was started on PO
diltiazem as above and continued on doxazosin.
.
# H/O DVT: Patient was diagnosed with DVT in [**2152-3-17**].
Reportedly completed coumadin course per Dr.[**Name (NI) 2179**] note in
the past, however was continued due to sedentary life. On
admission, patient had sub-therpeutic INR.  Patient was started
on SQH and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.  He was continued on
coumadin at home dose.  He requires daily INR levels as we are
initiating bactrim therapy, coumadin should be adjusted as seen
fit to maintain INR between [**12-20**].
.
# HIV: Last CD4 count 247. Continued home HAART regimen.
.
# Hypernatremia: On presentation to ED.  Improved with IVF.
.

Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPap
Intubation, extubation ([**2154-4-13**])


History of Present Illness:
69 year old male with history of HIV (CD4 116 [**2154-4-8**]), COPD
(2-4L at home), DVT on coumadin, hypertension, chronic lower
back [**Last Name (un) 2187**], osteoporosis who presents with respiratory distress.
The patient had been recently admitted 5/13-16/[**2153**] for COPD
exacerbation and treated with nebs, azithromycin, prednisone
(slow taper). The patient presented to the ED on [**2154-4-2**] for
dyspnea but left AMA before admission. He was sent to the ED on
[**2154-4-8**] but left AMA again, with prednisone and azithromycin
prescriptions which he never filled. He had seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
pulmonary clinic yesterday and had been non-compliant with
prednisone taper. He endorsed "exhaustion" at the appointment
but was stable 93% on 3.5L nasal cannula. The patient had also
been at [**Hospital **] Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2185**] prior to Pulmonary
appointment.
.
The patient re-presented to the ED today with worsening dyspnea
and was brought in by EMS in respiratory distress (enroute CO2
50). He responded to nebulizers enroute and arrived looking very
uncomfortable, using accessory muscles. He was tight on
pulmonary exam with minimal breath sounds and speaking few word
sentences. The patient was started on BiPap (50%, PSV 15, PEEP
5), which he tolerated well. He was briefly weaned off to 4L NC
but decompensated, tripoding despite Methylprednisolone 125mg IV
X1, Azithromycin 500mg, more nebulizers and ativan 2mg IV.
.
ROS: Patient denies fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, myalgias,
changes in bowel movement or urination.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old male with history of HIV (CD4 116 [**2154-4-8**]), COPD
(2-4L at home), DVT on coumadin, hypertension, chronic lower
back [**Last Name (un) 2187**], osteoporosis who presents with respiratory distress.

.
# Respiratory Distress: Most likely due to ongoing COPD
exacerbation. Trigger unclear given lack of pneumonia on initial
CXR, no fevers/chills, productive cough. Patient has been
non-compliant with medications, however, since discharge; this
includes prednisone and antibiotics. ?compliance with nebulizers
and has supplemental O2 at home. The patient has had CTA
recently to rule out pulmonary emboli given ongoing dyspnea
despite therapy. He was treated with azithromycin for 5 days and
methylprednisolone. He intermittently required BiPap. A plan was
made to use bipap at night once the patient was able to leave
the ICU. However on the morning of [**4-13**] patient was anxious,
tachypneic and desatted and required intubation.  The patient
was extubated on [**4-14**]. He did well overnight but subsequently
had further respiratory distress and his steroids were increased
to full burst.  He ultimately decided to be DNR/DNI and came to
the understanding that he wasn't going to get better; the
patient decided to become CMO and was discharged to home hospice
after discussing with Palliative Care in-house.
- Continue long steroid taper at home (Prednisone 60mg X 7 days,
40mg X 7 days, 20 mg X7 days, 10mg X 7 days, off)
- Continue supplemental oxygen, albuterol and ipratropium nebs
- Continue MS contin and morphine liquid PRN for air hunger,
shortness of breath
- Continue lorazepam PRN for air hunger, shortness of breath,
anxiety
.
# HIV: Down trending CD4 count, ?due to acute illness. Continued
abacavir, lamivudine, fosamprenavir, and atazanavir. Continued
Bactrim SS daily. Patient does have history of Bactrim needing
to be held in [**10/2153**] for bone marrow suppression. The need for
ongoing HAART medication and PCP prophylaxis was discussed with
the patient. It was felt that he likely will not succumb to
HIV/AIDS or an opportunistic infection before he succumbs to his
end-stage COPD. However, taking these medications are not a
hardship for the patient and he would prefer not to risk
increasing HIV viral load and chance of opportunistic infection,
especially in the setting of ongoing steroids.
- The patient will be discharged home on hospice with
continuation of his HAART medications and Bactrim PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
# DVT: LENI the day prior to admission as outpatient was
negative for DVT. Patient has been therapeutic and followed by
[**Hospital3 **] here at [**Company 191**]. He missed several doses of
Coumadin in the settting of being on Bipap and developed a
subtherapeutic INR. He was bridged with Lovenox. Anticoagulation
held [**4-13**] for concern for GIB but coumadin was resumed when hct
was stable for 24 hrs. Upon discharge home with hospice,
however, anticoagulation was discussed with the patient. As he
had a DVT in [**2152-3-17**] and ultimately completed treatment but was
continued given his sedentary/immobile nature, the indication
for ongoing anticoagulation and risk of DVT/PE is not high.
- Given this information, the patient chose to be discharged off
of coumadin. His primary care provider and the [**Name9 (PRE) 191**]
anticoagulation nurses were informed of his decision, and the
fact that he no longer needs INR checks.
.
#GIB: Patient noted to have guaic positive stool. T+S sent, PPI
started, PICC placed, transfused 1 unit of blood but did not
bump appropriately, so given 2nd unit. Hct then increased
appropriately and remained stable.
- PPI was stopped given the absence of frank melena on discharge
and to minimize medications for hospice.
.
# Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Seen in the ED during patient's
hospitalization [**2154-3-28**]. Patient was started on diltiazem in
this setting but did not have MAT last admission either. The
patient can continue on home diltiazem on discharge to prevent
discomfort from breakthrough tachycardia.
.
# Anemia: Slightly lower than baseline Hct close to 30.
Normocytic and previously thought due to chronic disease. HAART
medications may be contributing to marrow suppression. In
addition, pt noted to have guaic positive stools which are
discussed above.
.
# Hypertension: Stable, mildly hypertensive, continued [**Last Name (un) **]
diltiazem and doxazosin. -- doxazosin was stopped on discharge
for hospice to streamline medications.
.
# Osteoporosis: On Calcium and Vitamin D.
- These medications were stopped on discharge to streamline
medications.
.
# GERD: Admitted on famotidine. Stable, started on PPI as above
while intubated as famotidine can also interact with HIV
medications; also in setting of guaiac positive stools per
above.
- Famotidine was stopped on discharge to streamline medications.
.
# Other transitional issues:
- Continue home O2 as prescribed
- Oral suction as prescribed
- Maintain PICC with appropriate heparin flushes as a provision
for morphine infusion if patient's air hunger is refractory to
PO morphine elixir and he requires IV morphine

pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2190**] was admitted under the acute care surgery service on
[**2148-2-3**] for further evaluation and management of her injuries.
She was initially admitted to the trauma ICU for close
monitoring given her rib fractures, and was transferred to the
floor on HD#1 as she remained stable.

Neuro: She remained alert and oriented throughout her
hospitalization. Her pain level was routinely assessed. She was
initially administered IV narcotics for pain control, and was
transitioned to an oral regimen when tolerating PO's. Prior to
discharge, she reported adequate pain control on an oral
regimen.

CV: Her vital signs were monitored routinely and she remained
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Serial hct's were checked
given her liver lac, initially q6h on admission and then [**Hospital1 **].
They remained stable, and she remained without evidence of blood
loss.

Pulm: Given the small size of her pneumothorax, no chest tube
placement was necessary. Agressive pulmonary toileting and
incentive spirometry were encouraged. Nebulizer treatments were
administered. Her supplemental oxygen was able to be weaned.
Prior to discharge, her oxygen saturation was within normal
limits on room air. She remained without respiratory compromise.

GI: She was initially kept NPO with IV fluids for hydration and
an NG tube was placed on admission given her liver laceration.
Her hematocrit remained stable and abdominal exam remained
benign, so the NG tube was removed on [**2-4**] and she was started on
clear liquids. Her diet was slowly advanced over the next 24
hours and she was tolerating a regular diet at discharge. She
was started on a bowel regimen given her narcotic intake.

GU: A foley catheter was placed on admission. Her intake and
output were closely monitored. On [**2-5**] it was removed and she
voided without difficulty.

Musk: Orthopedics was consulted given her pelvic fractures and
lumbar transverse process fractures. These injuries were
determined to be stable requiring no surgical intervention.
Follow up in the orthopedic clinic was scheduled for 2 weeks
from discharge.

Physical therapy was consulted to evaluate her mobility, given
her injuries determined she was best suited going to rehab. The
patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition, pain
controlled on oral medication, tolerating a regular diet, and
urinating without difficulty.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after being struck by a motor
vehicle.  As a result of this accident you sustained multiple
injuries as listed below.

Your multiple rib fractures can cause severe pain and
subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the
pain.

*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep
breaths. If the pain medication is too sedating take half the
dose and notify your physician.

*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that
pool in the lungs.

*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to
hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing
and deep breathing.

*  Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short
periods may ease the pain.

*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid
and fiber intake if possible.

*  Do NOT smoke

*  If your doctor allows, non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin,
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation
around your ribs ( crepitus ).

History of Present Illness:
In brief, this is a 64 yo M with hx of melanoma s/p craniotomy
and resection of metastatic melanoma in brain. He was initially
admitted after found down on [**5-3**]. Had multiple intraparencymal
hematomas, SAH, SDH. Underwent resection of tumor and cyst
cavities on [**5-6**]. S/p craniotomy which was done on [**5-6**] he has
been aphasic and had ongoing myoclonic seizures. He was
monitored on EEG and last seizure was 3 days ago, thought to be
in setting of sepsis and lowered sz threshhold. He is currently
on max doses of dilantin and Keppra and being followed by neuro
for AED recommendations. He was transferred to MICU for
management of septic shock after blood cx grew enterobacter
cloacae (possibly spread from urine). He was on CTX but
currently on meropenem, afebrile, and no leukocytosis. He has a
PICC line in place for a 14-day course of meropenem. LP was done
in MICU and was normal. Throughout the MICU stay he has been
tachycardic with a fib and flutter intermittently on tele. On

Brief Hospital Course:
64M with h/o lung cancer in [**2169**] s/p resection, melanoma of left
arm s/p excision in [**2167**], who presented with left temporal
hemorrhage, secondary to metastatic melanoma, s/p craniotomy
with gross resection of lesion.

He initially presented after being found down and was admitted
to the ICU on neurosurgery service.  He underwent craintomy for
resection of his lesion and patholgoy returned as melanoma.

His hospital course was complicated by Afib with RVR and
ultimately rate controlled with oral diltizem and lopressor.  He
also developed enterobacter bacteremia and was treated for 14
days with meropenem.

Neuro-Oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss the possibility of XRT
or other chemotherapeutic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] however, the patient was too
agitated to tolerate mapping and sitting still long enough for
XRT.  Systemic chemotherapy was not considered given the
patient's many co-morbidities.  Several family meetings were
held to discuss his prognosis.  Initially the decision was made
to wait to see if his mental status improved, unfortunately it
did not.  Another family meeting was held and the decision was
made by his health care proxy to have him to go hospice and
focus on comfort.

He is being discharged to hospice.  All non-comfort related
medications were stopped prior to discharge. He should be
continued on pain medication, medication for atrial fibrillation
including aspirin, anti-seizure medication and GERD medication.

mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the
posterior descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
This 66 year old man has a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and obesity. He has been followed in the [**Month/Day/Year 2200**]
clinic for quite some time. Over the summer the patient noticed
several episodes of bilateral shoulder discomfort while walking
up a slight incline on the golf course. These episodes would
resolve quickly with rest and then he would be able to continue
on with the rest of his game without symptoms.

Several weeks ago the patient noticed similar bilateral shoulder
discomfort after walking only 100 feet.  He did not experience
any chest discomfort, shortness of breath or other associated
symptoms and again, after several minutes of rest his discomfort
resolved.

He sought consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2201**] who referred him for
stress testing. He exercised 8.25 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol,
reaching 79% of his maximum predicted heart rate. At peak
exercise there was diffuse 2.0-3.0 ST segment depression in the
inferior leads and 1.0-2.0 mm depression in leads I and V3-V6.
The rhythm was sinus with APB??????s and one PVC. Post exercise there
were frequent PVC??????s noted including ventricular bigeminy and
trigeminy. Imaging revealed a mostly reversible perfusion defect
of the septum and apex. A fixed inferior wall defect was also
noted.  LVEF was 48%. He is now referred for cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension, osteoarthritis, hypercholesterol, basal cell
carcinoma

Social History:
He is a retired owner of an auto radiator
company. He drinks a couple of glasses of beer or wine weekdays.

He does not smoke. He does like to exercise frequently with golf

but finds that quite difficult these days with discomfort. He
rates his pain as [**8-8**] with activity, [**5-9**] at rest. It is
predominantly anterior medial.

VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 140/80, temperature 98, pulse 66,
and weight 165.
NEURO:  He is walking without any limp or difficulty.
BACK:  There is no spinal tenderness.  He is very minimally
tender deep in his lower lumbosacral area on the right and over
the buttocks.  Fair reversible lumbar curvature of forward
flexion.  No pain with internal and external rotation at the
hips.
EXTREMITIES:  Straight leg raising is to almost 85-90 degrees
bilaterally.  DTRs are diminished bilaterally, about [**1-31**]+
bilaterally symmetric.  Ankle jerks are 2+ bilaterally.
Sensation and strength are intact to resistance testing.  Pulses
are normal.  No calf tenderness.  No ankle swelling.  No thigh
tenderness and again, sensation is intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2202**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-3-31**] for elective
surgical management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken
to the operating room where he underwent three vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. He had hypotension requiring pressors.
He was transfused with a unit of packed red blood cells which.
On postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. Stopped

Radiology:
CXR [**11-16**]: Diffusely increased opacities at the lung fields
bilaterally. In an immunocompromised patient, this is concerning
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Radiographically, the differential includes
pulmonary edema. Additionally, there is a faint opacity at the
right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or focal
pneumonic process.
.
CT-Head [**11-16**]: Focus of low attenuation within the subcortical
white matter of the right medial frontal lobe. This may
represent a subacute infarction; however, an underlying mass
lesion cannot be completely excluded. An MRI examination with
gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for
further evaluation. No intracranial hemorrhage noted.
.
MR-head-w&w/o gadolinium [**11-18**]:
Signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving
the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. This
finding most likely represent a small infarct. However, in
absence of ADC map, age of the infarct could not be determined.
No abnormal enhancement is seen. Follow up is suggested, if
clinically indicated.
.
Echo [**11-18**]:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. While difficult to
assess given the limited views suspect Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
If clinically indicated, would recommend a TEE.
.
CXR [**11-21**]:
Resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
.
Studies:
EEG [**11-17**]: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of
a slow
and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing -
all
consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or
anoxic
etiology. No evidence for ongoing seizures is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for UC (prednisone,
6MP) who presents with new onset HA, fever with bacterial
meningitis and gram positive rod bacteremia.
.
#. Listeriosis - meningitis and bacteremia. Patient presented
with headache, nuchal rigidity, expressive aphasia, afebrile on
admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED, where she also started to
have rigors.  LP showed >300 WBC, poly predominant with 5%
monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16.  CSF gram stain showed gram
positive rods, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation
eventually grew listeria. Empiric treatment based on gram stain
was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and
question of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending
confirmation of gram stain and culture results.  Once
speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was
started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd.
Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**11-21**], when it was changed to prophylaxis dose.  Early on
admission, she developed hypotension that required levophed, but
was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of
admission with PRBCs (total of 4 units) and volume
resussitation.  Given bacteremia, TTE was done, no vegetations
or lesions noted. Head CT on admission showed right medial
frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, no hemorrhage.
Subsequent MRI confirmed infarct, unclear date, and EEG
consistent with meningitis.  Neurology was consulted, and the
patient was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis given
meningoencephalitis. She spiked fevers to 101-102 over the first
several days of admission.  By [**11-19**], her neurological exam was
markedly improved, and by [**11-21**] her headache was gone, no
meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essential tremor
was slightly more severe. Surveillance blood cultures reamined
negative from [**11-17**] on.  Notably, she was transferred from ICU
to floor on [**11-21**], but noninvasive BP was read as 60/d, patient
mentating well, sent back to ICU. In the ICU, an arterial line
was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmHg higher than
sphyngomanometer.  This discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but
persistent.  Patient maintained normal mentation, good urine
output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear
reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points.  On
[**11-23**], she was sent to the floor for further care and management.
.
#. Bilateral lung opacities/hypoxia. Initial chest film read as
increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP (given
steroids and no PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5**]) vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. pulmonary
edema. She had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her
respiratory distress led to her being placed on CPAP+PS.  The
origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be
secondary to likely vascular leak from sepsis/CHF versus PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**]
induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not
repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and
susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of PCP was small.  She
responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced O2 requirements.
.
#. UC: She continued to receive her outpatient dose of
prednisone, which was changed on [**11-22**] to dexamethasone IV; her
outpatient 6-MP was held. After several days with no diarrhea,
it recurred on [**11-22**] soon after her diet had advanced. C.diff was
negative. She was made NPO, and fed via TPN for bowel rest.  On
[**11-24**], it was noted that she began passing BRBRP, her hematocrit
was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and
consent for blood transfusion.
.
#. Anemia. On admission, she was found to be anemic. She
received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again [**11-19**] for mixed
venous sat <70%.  She was found to have iron binding studies c/w
anemia of chronic disease.  Her HCT was followed closely, and
remained stable for the remainder of her admission.
.
#. FEN: Her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made NPO
with TPN on [**11-22**] after she developed diarrhea, thought secondary
to continued UC activity.
.
#. Prophylaxis: PPI. Hold SQ Hep, pneumoboots. Initially on
droplet precautions.
.
#. Code status: FULL
.
#. Communication: patient, her sister, brother, and mother
.
#. Lines: peripheral IV x 2. left subclavian CC.  A-line. Eval
for PICC; once in place, can d/c central line, a-line.

Surgery Discharge part:
Pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on
[**2147-11-26**].  She was on Clinda/Gent peri-procedure and Amplicillin
for 21 days at first.  She was seen by PT/OT and was NPO until
the ostomy started to function.  SHe had c/o nausea as diet was
tolerated and it was slowed down.  MRI was suspicious for an
abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6
weeks as per ID.  She was given a PICC.  On [**12-5**] she was
cleared by PT and was in good condition for d/c to rehab on
[**2147-12-5**].

History of Present Illness:
61F w/ sign PMH for UC s/p colectomy, Stage II breast cancer
presented on day 13 of second cycle of chemotherapy with fever
to 100.6 at home w/ severe rigors. She took two Ibuprofen at
home and then went to onc clinic today where she was then
referred to the ED for admission. She stated that for the past
two days she has noticed an increasing amount of stool output in
her ostomy bag but denies abdominal discomfort or blood in her
stool. She has had nausea but similar to how she has felt in the
past with chemo. She also mentioned that she recently cut her
finger in the garden on Sunday which is now red and slightly
tender to the touch. She otherwise denies any vomiting, rash,
rhinorrhea, dysuria, cough, SOB or abdominal discomfort. She
denies any recent travel or sick contacts as well.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, Temp: 101 ??????F (38.3 ??????C), Pulse: 93,
RR: 16, BP: 77/38, O2Sat: 94, O2Flow: RA. Her labs were notable
for WBC of 0.7 and PMN count of 21. Her U/A was bland and two
blood cultures were obtained and are pending. His CXR did not
show definitive source of infection either. She was started on
Cefepime for neutropenic fever. While in the ED she developed
hypotension not responding to IVF boluses, the pt denied CVL
placement and required the initiation of phenylepherine
peripherially in order to maintain SBPs in the 90s-100s. She did
not have a change in her mentation during these episodes of
hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] is a 61 yo w/ Stage II breast cancer who was
admitted on day 13 or cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide who developed fever to 100.6 at home with
associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia.
.
#Neutropenic Fever- On presentation the pt's PMN count was 21
most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of
Neulasta use. Two possible sources of infection existed
including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered
while gardening. She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and
cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to
cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased
ostomy output.  When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was
discontinued. Blood cultures were sent and a U/A was not
concerning for infection. We also sent off galactomannan antigen
and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic
fever workup which were negative. The following day after
admission her WBC rose significantly and she no longer was
neutropenic. As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and
he CXR became concerning for an infiltrate. She was continued on
Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than
48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to
complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.
.
# Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding
to IVF boluses. She refused central line placement in the ED and
peripheral pressors were initiated. This is most likely related
to her underlying infectious process. She was not administered
any medications recently that could be accounting for her
hypotension. Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures
are sbp of 90s-100s. An a-line was obtained which showed higher
BP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. She
was given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off
pressors the night of admission to the ICU. Her cuff and a-line
pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line
was discontinued.
.
# Breast Cancer- currently in cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide. Most likely this current episode of
neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given
during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the
rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was
also a possibility.
.
# Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at
home doses.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear [**Known firstname 17**],

It was a pleasure to take care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were
admitted for low white cell (neutrophil count), fever, and
pneumonia. You required monitoring with blood pressure
supporting medications and IV antibiotics in the intensive care
unit. Fortunately, your counts improved and you responded nicely
to the antibiotics. Please continue to take levofloxacin to
treat your pneumonia for a total of 8 days (last dose on
[**2154-5-7**]). As we discussed if you notice fever, worsening
breathing problems, or any other concerning symptoms to return
to the emergency room immediately.

We have made the following changes to your medications:

START levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for 4 more days
([**2154-5-7**])

You should discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] the possibility of restarting
neulasta with your next chemotherapy cycle.

Chief Complaint:
Febrile, unresponsive--> GBS meningitis and bacteremia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Rigid bronchoscopy, debridement, T-tube placement.
2. Baclofen Pump Removal.
3. RUQ Hematoma Evacuation.
4. Percutaneous Gastrostomy Tube.
5. Left Antecubital PICC Line.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS
[**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump
placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic
respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who
presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her
nursing home.  According to notes from [**Hospital6 33**], the
pt was found at her nursing home yesterday ([**3-26**]) AM, shaking
her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed
seizure). She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 34**] ED.
.
In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR
12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the
ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV
ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin,
Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that
the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed.
Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia
of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP
was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys,
glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+
cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**3-9**] bottles. Micro
lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was
positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and
ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also
given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**]. CXR showed
cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an
abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed
questionable changes from prior that might suggest the
possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly
to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt
was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for
spasticity
2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to
chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last
admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis
3. Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times
requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed
because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to
respiratory weakness
1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration
4. COPD
5. HTN
6. Osteoporosis
7. Scarlet fever as a child
8.  Chronic constipation
9. Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer


Social History:
Social History: Pt is widowed. She has no children. She
currently lives in a nursing home. Has been there since '[**65**]? She
has no hx of smoking, EtOH, IVDU. Will call sister tomorrow for
more information.

Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:

TTE on admission:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen.
.
CT abd post-op:
1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper
quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal
wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The
covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**3-28**], [**2171**].

2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent
stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If
clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further
characterization.

3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.

4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases.
.
EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the

presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized
slowing
followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were
independent
bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep,
midline
subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe
encephalopathy.
A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of
the encephalopathy.
.
EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage
II sleep
with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of
intermittent and
independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both
sides.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and
is
consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In
addition,
exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the
underlying
infection.
.
MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be
due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute
infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild
communicating hydrocephalus.
.
MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the
superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of
thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow
signal.
.
MRA [**4-4**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No
evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
.
TEE:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve.
7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Head CT [**4-7**]: Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. GBS meningitis/bactermia
In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on
Gentamicin (for synergy). Her intrathecal baclofen pump was
thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying
pump in RUQ). Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the
operation appeared to be without complication. The following
day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be
hypotensive with an SBP of 70. After spiking a temp, it was
thought that she might be septic. She was given fluids, PRBCs,
FFP, and placed on Levophed. Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm
hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site. Pt was taken
emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow
ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. She returned to
the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. Given 1
additional unit of PRBCs. Her hct bumped appropriately and
remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. Pt
developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought
to be [**1-8**] to PCN allergy. Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly
with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone. Repeat
LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially
responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). CSF
analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. Prior to
leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. She was pancultured
and all cultures were negative. A TTE ruled out endocarditis in
the setting of group B strep bacteremia.  On day #12 of
gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of
her treatment course.
.
2. RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen
pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to
be bleeding into the RUQ pocket.  She was taken to the OR for
emergent evacuation of the hematoma.  On POD #16, pt was noted
to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ.
Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal
ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but
found a new fluid collection.  Surgery was consulted and they
diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given
that it had no signs of infection.
.
3. Pneumonia:
Towards the end of the pt's ICU stay, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the
passy-muir valve.  She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent
for culture.  The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram
negative rods (not pseudomonas).  She was started on vancomycin
for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR.
Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas,
ceftaz was stopped.  Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that
were persistently high.  Vancomycin troughs should be checked
often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.  After the
pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased
secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was
assumed that the pt aspirated.  That day she also spiked a
temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-20**] (14-day course)
and Flagyl's course will be complete on [**4-24**] (after 10 days).
.
4. Supraglottic edema
As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she
failed a passy-muir valve.  On bronchoscopy it was noted that
she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and
the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.  She was
taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where
her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.
ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to
evaluate her anatomy.  The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and
narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.  Ideally, she
will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the
patient has recovered from her acute illnesses.
.
5. Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct
drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained
stable.
.
6. Multiple sclerosis
Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. She was
without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr HR, temp, BP,
seizures) once pump was removed. She continued on Baclofen 20mg
qid po with an Ativan taper. PO baclofen was then tapered to
20mg tid.
.
7. Mental status
At baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she
is alert, oriented, and conversant. Her decreased responsiveness
was thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to
have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished
reponsiveness persisted. Repeat LP in the unit suggested a
resolving meningitis.  Neurology was following the pt and
recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke
at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule
out subclinical seizures.  An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with
severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with
meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.  An MRI was
finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating
hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and
eventually returned to her baseline mental status.  Pt's mental
status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology
as an outpatient.
.
8. Respiratory status
After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated
thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (At
baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis
but does not require mechical ventilation. Trach in place to
help with clearance of secretions.)  Pt placed on A/C in unit,
then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask
with good results.  At time of discharge, she was satting well
on 40% trach mask.
.
9. HTN
In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay
became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s. Pt has hx of
hypertension. Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen
d/c. BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s
on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
10. Sacral decub ulcer: Stage 1-2.  Wound care nurse followed
while pt was in-house.
.
11. FEN: During pt's acute illness, she had an NGT placed.
Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids
and pureed food.  The following day, she was noted to have soup
coming out of her trach so she was again made NPO.  Pt then
passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration
after trying some ground solids.  She was made NPO and GI placed
a PEG for feeding.  Pt should remain on tube feeds until her
tracheal swelling is much improved.  At that point, another
swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po
feeding.

Echo [**2198-11-26**]
Conclusions:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
[**2193-4-18**], left ventricular dysfunction is new and mild aortic
regurgitation
is now detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63 yo male with cardiac arrest [**3-7**] paroxysmal high degree
AV block, s/p collapse with PEA arrest now with temp pacer
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further mgmt and permanent pacemaker
placement.
.
1. Rhythm: paroxysmal high degree block, temp pacer placed.
reasons for initial collapse are unclear, possibly combination
of high degree av block and electrolyte disturbances, since
patient was on many K+sparing diuretics.  Tele after admission
showed V-paced with few PVCs.  Pt underwent pacemaker placement
on [**2198-11-26**] without complications.  The next day device
interrigation was satisfacotory.  CXR did not show a
pneumothorax or any acute processes.  Pt remained without
complaints and was discharged on [**2198-11-27**].  Indications for
pacer was symptomatic with high degree block.
.
2. Coronaries: risk factors, [**Location (un) 47**] risk 17%, ruled out for
MI w/trop leak but flat CKs after arrest. -Cont ASA, BB, statin
- lipids checked : total chol 122, HDL 36, LDL 68.  Continued on
lipitor 20.
- initially held ACEI given [**Doctor First Name 48**] upto Creatinine of 2.2.  Given
his hyperkalemia on presentation pt was not restarted on ACE
inhibitors as his BP was well controlled.
- Repeat Echo (see below) showed EF of 50%.  Given this event
would recommend an outpatient evaluation by cardiologist for
likely exercise stress test.
.
3. Pump: EF [**2193**] was 60% w/LAE, likely diastolic dysfunction,
mild hypervolemia w/?mild pulm edema causing mild hypoxia,
initially gentle diuresis with goals -500cc to -1L.
- Continued amlodipine and metoprolol for rate control
- held ace/arbs due to [**Doctor First Name 48**]
- echo [**11-26**] showed EF of 50%.
- During the admission pt did not go onto complain any further
of Chest pain or Shortness of breath.
.
4. ARF/CRI: acute insult likely combo of triamterene and NSAIDS,
aggrevated by diuretics and ACE-I. Baseline 1.3-1.5 with
proteinuria long standing, should avoid NSAIDS for life.
-Discontinued ACE-I/ARBa and diuretics.
-Checked FeUrea, FeUrea: 36.5%, confirming ATN. spep and upep
(given anemia, pending), had u/s at [**Hospital1 46**] but should have
repeat as outpt to check complex cysts vs masses. Renal diet.
.
5. Anemia: new,  SPEP was negative, UPEP negative for bence
[**Doctor Last Name 49**] proteins,  and iron, shows anemia likely due to renal
causes
-PCP may consider [**Name9 (PRE) 50**] as outpt given pt's age and anemia.
.
6. Thombocytopenia: new, mild and stable during the admission.
.
7. Elevated glucose: possibly continued stress response, check
FS wnl.
.
8. h/o hypokalemia:  PCP may consider Nephrologist follow up.
Would Recommend outpt mineralocorticoid XS work-up once off K
sparing diuretics for a while.
.
9. Hip pain: awaiting THR. vicodin prn. No NSAIDs due to renal
problems.

10. Communicate with friend, preferred HCP per pt, [**Name (NI) 51**]

Discharge Instructions:
You have had a pacemaker placed because of electrical block in
your heart. This may have been precipitated by kidney failure
and too much potassium in your blood. Do not take the
medications you were taking prior to this event. We have
enclosed a list of and prescriptions for your new medication
needs. Please take these as directed and discuss any changes
with your primary care doctor.
.
You have many risks for coronary heart disease. We feel you need
a stress test with imaging in the next month to make sure that
you do not have any significant need for a cardiac
catheterization. Until then, taking aspirin, your Toprol XL
(beta blocker safe in renal failure), your lipitor, and
eventually starting your lisinopril again will protect you
somewhat from heart attacks.
.
You must never take NSAID medications again. Your kidney disease
makes this dangerous. Avoid ibuprofen, advil, motrin, aleve,
naproxen, or ketoprofen. Talk with your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 57**] if
you are unsure about any medications you are taking.


Followup Instructions:
1. See your primary care doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58**] on Friday 28th at
2:30pm, to check your potassium and creatinine levels and to
discuss everything we recommended. Have your doctor follow up on
the serum and urine protein electrophoresis that was pending
when you were discharged as well as the final report of your
echocardiogram. Talk with your doctor about your anemia and
whether or not you would need a bone marrow biopsy.

2. Go to the pacemaker DEVICE CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**]
Date/Time:[**2198-12-3**] 11:30

3. You should see our nephrologists sometime for your kidney
disease. Talk with your primary doctor about this and call for
an appointment [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60**].

4. You should also setup an appointment with a cardiologist to
have a exercise stress test done as outpatient.  You can speak
with your PCP regarding [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cardiologist or you can call [**Hospital 61**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] to setup an appointment here.

Pertinent Results:
CT head:
Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. Recommend head CTA
to evaluate for an intracranial aneurysm.
Findings were discussed with Dr.

CTA:
FINDINGS: There is a 3 mm x 3 mm saccular outpouching from the
region of the anterior communicating artery (2:317), consistent
with aneurysm. This has a very narrow neck, and would be
amenable to endovascular intervention. No other aneurysm or
vascular abnormality is seen.
There is stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery.
Otherwise, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major
branches are patent, with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
The distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm on
the right, and 5 mm on the left.
Mild-to-moderate multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes
are noted.
IMPRESSION: 3 mm saccular aneurysm arising from the anterior
communicating
artery, with narrow neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83**] was admited on [**2175-3-12**] and became increasingly
lethargic and transferred to the ICU for further care under the
Neurosurgery service. A diagnostic CTA revealed a large ACOM
aneursym which was coiled the following day.

Post Coiling the pt. was admitted to the ICU with a ventricular
drain. There were no incidences of increased intracranial
pressure or decline. A cerebral perfusion study performed [**3-15**]
confirmed the lack of vasospasm and develoing strokes.

He had some R shoulder weakness and shoulder X-ray was
concerning for rotator cuff injury and orthopedics was
consulted.

On [**2179-3-16**]/14/15 his ventricular drain was clamped and reopened
due to elevated ICP levels. On [**3-19**] he was transferred to the
SDU and continued to remain stable.  He had his ventricular
drain clamped on [**3-21**] and after 48 hours of the clamping trial
he had a CT done which was stable without any evidence of
hydrocephalus. At this time the drain was pulled.

He was placed on a fluid restriction for a brief period of time
for a drop in his Na level, and also on salt tabs, upon
discharge to rehab we have removed the fluid restriction, but we
are continuing the salt tabs, we advise that the Na level be
checked every other day, and the salt tabs may be d/c'ed when Na
is stable on serial checks. Upon discharge his Na is 138.

He is now ready for discharge to rehab.

On discharge his exam is as follows:

Alert and Oriented X2
Moving all extremities with full strength
slight Right Drift, which has been persistant throughout his
hospitalization, and possibly secondary to a rotator cuff
injury.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2199-1-22**]:
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major cortical
territorial infarction.

CXR [**2199-1-22**]:
: New right lower lobe confluent opacity which may represent a
developing area of pneumonia. Differential diagnosis includes
aspiration and
atelectasis. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph is
suggested for more
complete characterization when the patient's condition permits.

no contrast head CT [**2199-1-28**]
 FINDINGS: There has been interval development of an area of
decreased attenuation at the left basal ganglia and
periventricular white matter in the distribution of the left
lenticulostriate artery consistent with a subacute infarct.
There is associated swelling with mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. Additional areas of hypodensity in the
periventricular white matter and right centrum semiovale are
unchanged and consistent with old infarctions. Two calcified
meningiomas are again seen arising at the left frontal dura and
anterior olfactory groove. They are unchanged from prior study.
No intracranial hemorrhage was identified. Surrounding osseous
and soft-tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Subacute left lenticulostriate infarction which was
not present on head CT of [**2199-1-22**]

echo [**2199-1-28**]:

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a
severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well  seen. There is probably mild aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral  regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is a significant  left ventricular inflow gradient which
may be due to mitral annular  calcification and mitral valve
calcification. The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

LENI [**2199-1-24**]:
No evidence of thrombus within the right upper extremity

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted with hypernatremia and acute mental status
changes and right sided paralysis. Her corrected sodium on
admission was about 170s and her free water deficit was 5.5L.
She was volume repleted with normal saline. She also recieved
D51/4 NS for free water repletion initially and this was changed
to free water boluses through nasogastric tube. Her sodium
gradually trended down with free water repletion. She also was
in pre-renal renal failure and her creatinine trended down with
hydration.

With regards to the acute mental changes, this is partially
explained by the hypernatrmic state. However, she was also noted
by the nursing home to have right sided weakness. CT head was
performed on admission which was negative for stoke. Neurology
was consulted and found that she has a MCA territory stroke by
exam. A repeat CT head was performed on [**1-28**] which showed
watershed infarct. TTE which was also obtained did not reveal
any thrombus.Per neurology recommendation, all her hypertensive
medication has been discontinued and she was started on aspirin.


Chest XRay on admission was concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia. Her sputum culture grew MSSA for which she was on
oxacillin. Levofloxacin was also started for community acquired
pneumonia. Nasal aspirate was sent for influenza and was
negative. She was intubated on [**2199-1-24**] for increased respiratory
effort. Her resporatory decompensation was likely from
aspiration pneumonia. She was extubated on [**2199-1-31**] when her
lungs mechanic improved. However, given her  depressed mental
status and stroke, she was not able to clear her secretions
well. SHe was intubated again on [**2-2**] after unsuccessful attempt
to maintain her oxygen saturation with high flow mask. She
recieved tracheostomy and G tube and tolerated well post
procedure.

Her  nutrition status was maintained by tubefeeds and insulin
sliding scale and NPH kept her glucose within range.

Her blood pressure was initially low on admission. This
responded well to hydration and brief use of levophed. Her [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stimulation test was responsive. Admission EKG showed ST
depression in V2-V3 and it was unsure if this is old. She had
slightly elevated troponin, likely from acute renal failure
which eventually trending down.

Plastic surgery was consulted for decubitus ulcer. No
debridement was indicated and their recommendation was to
maxmize nutrition, wet to dry dressing and tight glucose
control.

She remained on sc heparin, lansoprazole, pneumoboots and bowel
regimen as part of her porphylaxis. She had picc line placed
upon discharge

THere had been multiple discussion with her daughter, which is
her health care proxy regarding code status. It was felt by the
medical team that her condition will not likely improve despite
optimal medical treatment. However, due to religious reasons,
her family remained steadfast that everything should be done.
However, her family agrees that should she go into cardiac
arrest, there should be no chest compression or defibrillation.

history. Per husbandpt has had a severe cough since discharge
from hosp productive for clear sputum. Overall has had a cough
for ~3 mos (had been treated for PNA X2 most recently [**2174-5-15**]).
She saw her cardiologist and who stopped her ramipril and
switched her to losartan 1 day PTA. She has not had any fevers,
nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. Of note she had aoritc
valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-10**] (initially valve area 0.56cm2, gradient
27 -> after the procedure the calculated aortic valve area was
0.74 cm2 and gradient 12 mmHg.) Pt has been on dialysis in the
past but with improvement in creatinine she was not dialysed on
Thursday (last dialysis [**2174-5-24**]).

Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**4-/2174**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified
left
main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The
left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion.
2. LV ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug
eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher).
.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2174-5-20**] demonstrated:The left
atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic

Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2174-6-4**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise,
no major
change.

CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving
pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen.
.
Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **]
with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears
fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained
difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor
urine output.
- Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  Were held
initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her
admission.
- Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial
of lasix proved successful.  She will now go home on 160 mg PO
daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], her nephrologist.
She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition
consult during stay.
.
# CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p
recent LCx stent.  She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix,
and Losartan.

.
#. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty
[**2174-5-11**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family:
per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr.
[**Name (NI) 137**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve
replacment due to "calcifications." Patient may be candidate for
new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last
[**Name (NI) 113**].  Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge.
.
# Respiratory distress resolved -
Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial
secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by
elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram
stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight
while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents
resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only
given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started
[**5-29**], continued for 7 days.  She will continue lasix as
outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema.
.
# ANEMIA/GIB:
HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if
represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**5-31**] and this
demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely
representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and
haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal
limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u
PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since.
Her Hcts were between 26 and 28.  Stools were checked for guiac,
and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  We discharged her
home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to
continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss.  She is not
actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts.  We also
recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  Although, she needs to be
very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid
shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr):
Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to
hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been
initiated on HD in [**2174-3-15**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to
admission. Volume overload/CHF on admission, improved with UF,
now appears euvolemic. Creatinine 1.... on discharge.  Pt has
history of RCC with nephrectomy.  Renal function has seemed to
normalize.  Will continue follow up with nephrologist and he
will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter.

#  Pt was discharge to home with services for PT and home health
care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service

Facility:
[**Hospital 119**] Homecare

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
1. Respiratory Failure
2. CHF
3. Renal Failure

Secondary Diagnoses:
1. Aortic Stenosis
2. Anemia
3. HTN


Discharge Condition:
Stable, afebrile, pt walking with a walker, eating on her own,
with a normal mental status.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your
lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  You
were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on
your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with
diuretics.  We also are continuing to give you the medicines
carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off
your lungs.

In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission.
Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].  You also have a dialysis catheter in
your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an
outpatient.

We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  You should
meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy.  Make sure
to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the
bowel preparation they plan for you.

Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight >
3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  Call the nutritionist with any
questions.

Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest
pain, dizziness or fainting or any other worrisome symptoms, do
not hesitate to call your doctor or call 911 in case of
emergency.

Service:  Medicine [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female who has a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease, hypertension, dementia, recurrent
pneumonia and recent gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease,
who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of
increasing shortness of breath.  The patient had been at home
for approximately 2 days following discharge from rehab
following gastrectomy when shortness of breath developed.
Emergency medical services were called and the patient was
found to have an oxygen saturation of 65% on room air and 85%
on 100% non-re-breather.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroid.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy for
perforated ulcer.
5.  Dementia.
6.  Esophageal motility disorder.
7.  Recurrent pneumonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Living situation - the patient at baseline
resides at home with 24 hour home health assistance.  There
is extensive family involvement.  The patient's code status
is DNR, DNI.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aricept 10 mg.
2.  Lasix 40 mg.
3.  Prevacid 30 mg.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
5.  Multi-vitamin.
6.  Effexor 70 mg.
7.  Prednisone 25 mg.
8.  Zofran p.r.n.
9.  Synthroid 15 mg.

EXAM:  On presentation to the emergency department the
patient was found to have vital signs as follows:
Temperature 98.7, heart rate 82, blood pressure 160/62,
respiratory rate 25, oxygen saturation 87% on room air.  In
general, the patient is a well nourished but thin female in
respiratory distress.  There was no jugular venous distention
on examination of the neck.  Lung exam revealed decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam was
unremarkable.  The PEG site was clean, dry and intact.  The
patient was alert and oriented only to person.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Admission CBC was unremarkable.
Admission SMA-7 was significant for an elevated BUN to
creatinine ratio consistent with dehydration.  Urinalysis was
unremarkable.  Cardiac enzymes were significant for an
isolated elevated troponin.  Coagulation studies were
unremarkable.  Arterial blood gas on 100% oxygen was
significant for a decreased pO2 of 70 and an elevated pCO2 of
59 with a normal pH.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on admission revealed mild congestive
heart failure, markedly improved since the prior study of
[**2188-8-17**].  There was also bilateral lower lobe
opacification concerning for pneumonia.  CT angiogram
revealed consolidations at both lung bases consistent with
bibasilar pneumonia as well as subtle patchy opacifications
in the upper lobes with air fluid levels in the esophagus
suggesting possible aspiration.  There was no evidence of
pulmonary embolism.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  EKG on admission revealed sinus rhythm with
mild left axis deviation.  There was also felt to be possible
left anterior fascicular block.  The admitting MICU team
noted possible ST elevations in V3 through V6.
Echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal left ventricular cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.  There
was normal right ventricular systolic function.  There was
also moderate aortic regurgitation.  No pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory distress:  On admission, the patient was felt
to have bilateral pneumonia, most likely secondary to
aspiration.  The patient was started on IV Levaquin, Flagyl
and Vancomycin to cover for likely aspiration in a setting of
recent nursing home admission.  The patient was kept on
supplemental oxygen to keep oxygen saturations above 92% and
was kept NPO on aspirations precautions.  On day of admission
antibiotics were changed to IV ceftazidine, Flagyl and
Vancomycin.  Vancomycin was dosed at 1 gram q24 hours in the
setting of patient's decreased renal function, age and body
size.  On day two of admission the patient was also felt to
be fluid over loaded and gentle diuresis was resumed.  On day
two of admission the patient was felt to be stable for
transfer to the floor.  On the floor, the patient was
initially continued on IV antibiotics.  On day five of
admission the patient had a follow up chest x-ray which
revealed marked improvement in bibasilar pneumonia.  The
patient also had improvement in oxygen saturation and was
able to tolerate room air.  As a result, the patient was
transitioned to p.o. antibiotics and was given Augmentin and
Flagyl through the PEG tube.  The patient was discharged home
on hospital day 9 with instructions to complete a 14 day
course of p.o. antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Elevated troponin as well as possible ST
elevations on admission were felt to reflect a demand
ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes and EKG changes stabilized.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, Lopressor throughout the
admission.  On day three of admission the patient had an
episode of sinus tachycardia likely secondary to dehydration
versus multi-focal atrial tachycardia secondary to pulmonary
disease.  This resolved following hydration.  The patient's
cardiovascular function remained stable for the rest of the
admission.

3.  Dementia:  The patient was continued on Aricept
throughout the admission.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  Following rehydration, the patient was
found to have a mildly decreased hematocrit.  As a result,
the patient was received an elevation by gastroenterology to
look for gastrointestinal bleeding as an etiology of
decreased hematocrit.  Given the patient's history of peptic
ulcer disease, gastroenterology service recommended H. pylori
serology, which was negative.  Iron studies were sent, which
revealed a decreased total iron binding capacity as well as
decreased iron suggestive of a combination of both blood loss
and chronic disease as etiologies of anemia.
Gastroenterology service felt, however, that EGD and
colonoscopy were not an option in setting of patient's recent
ischemic cardiac disease.  Furthermore, the patient refused
gastroenterology work up.  Gastroenterology service also
asked to evaluate patient for possible contribution of reflux
of jejunostomy tube feedings to development of aspiration
pneumonia.  Gastroenterology service felt that reflux of
J-tube feedings was unlikely, however, felt that patient's
long history of esophageal dysmotility could be contributing
to aspiration.  They recommended swallowing study.  The
patient received an oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic
swallowing evaluation on day five of admission.  This
revealed mild oral with moderate to severe pharyngoesophageal
dysphagia with significant impaired upper esophageal
sphincter opening leading to severe residue of solids in the
pharynx.  However, there was no aspiration.  Nevertheless,
swallowing service recommended the patient in future have
only thin liquids, pureed solids or very finely/minced meat
in p.o. diet.  They also recommended that the patient sit
bolt upright at meals and for 45 minutes after meals.  They
recommended the patient remain at 45 degrees in bed at all
times and should never lay flat in bed and recommended that
if patient must remain flat in bed that tube feedings be
discontinued for 30 minutes prior to patient laying flat in
bed.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on Levothyroxine
for hypothyroidism.

6.  GU:  The patient was placed on Foley catheter on
admission to the hospital.  On day seven of admission the
patient was ready for discharge from a medical standpoint,
but did not void in time status post discontinuation of the
Foley catheter.  As a result the patient remained in-house
for an additional day to ensure the patient could void
spontaneously following discontinuation of Foley catheter.

POST DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metronidazole 500 mg q8 hours x7
days, Augmentin 500/125 mg p.o. b.i.d. x7 days, furosemide 40
mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Venlafaxine HCL 75 mg capsule p.o. q.d.,
Levothyroxine 150 mcg p.o. q.d., donepezile hydrochloride 10

p.o. q.d., multi-vitamin.

DISPOSITION:  To home with visiting nurse as well as 24 hour
home health assistance.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On day of discharge, the patient was
ambulating, voiding spontaneously and had oxygen saturation
of 97% on two liters.  The patient was demented in a manner
consistent with baseline.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aspiration pneumonia.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for right upper lobe small
cell cancer stage III, status post chemotherapy and
radiation, status post right upper lobe sleeve resection
[**6-19**], also with past medical history significant for diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, prostate cancer status post radical
prostatectomy, GERD, TIA 15 years ago, gout and COPD. The
patient has no known drug allergies.  The patient is status
post right upper lobe lung sleeve resection on [**6-19**] for small
cell lung cancer.  The patient was discharged home doing well
until four days prior to admission when he presented to the
Emergency Room with shortness of breath and fevers.  The
patient was given Levaquin and was then discharged home
again.  He continued having shortness of breath and
productive cough.  He was admitted [**7-11**] for a follow-up
bronchoscopy during which time they found a right middle lobe
obstruction secondary to swelling.  After the procedure the
patient had shortness of breath with an oxygen saturation of
88 as well as rigors and chills.  The patient was also found
to have poor color.  The patient's O2 saturation improved.
Chest x-ray was obtained and the patient was admitted.  The
patient underwent surgery [**2175-7-15**].  The patient underwent
completion pneumonectomy, bronchoscopy and serratus flap
closure of right main stem bronchus.

Postoperative day #1 the patient was afebrile with heart rate
of 56, blood pressure 104/56, satting at 99%.  Chest tube
output 500 cc.  Last gas 7.33, 56, 152, 31 and 100%.  On exam
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Incision,
dressings were clean, dry and intact. Heart was regular rate
and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, non distended.
Extremities had no swelling. White count 13.4, hematocrit
38.5, platelet count 394,000, potassium 4.8, BUN 13,
creatinine .6 with glucose of 188, magnesium 1.8 and CPK of
1410.  Plan was to wean the oxygen and check an ABG later on
and continue the pneumonectomy tube.  To check an EKG because
of the EKG change this morning in which patient had ST
segment elevations, undergo rule out MI protocol.

Postoperative day #2 the patient had no events over the last
24 hours, patient remained afebrile.  Heart rate 60, normal
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 105/58, satting at 97% on four
liters, last gas 7.39, 52, 96, 33.  Laboratory data revealed
white count 13.2, hematocrit 33.8, platelet count 322,000, PT
12.9, PTT 25.7, INR 1.1, potassium 4.7, BUN 15, creatinine .5
with glucose 158 and magnesium 1.7.  CK, 840.  Chest x-ray
pending.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to administer
Lasix today after transfer to the floor.  Infectious disease
came by to see the patient postop day #2 as well because they
were requested to recommend an antibiotic for the right
infiltrate to prevent the possibility of a postoperative
empyema.  Their recommendation was to continue with the
current IV antibiotics.  Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone will be
present. In the remote chance of postoperative infection
empyema these antibiotics will be present in the cavity and
also by peripheral circulation.

Postoperative day #3, events over the last 24 hours include
atrial fibrillation.  Patient mildly febrile at 99.2, heart
rate 57 and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 102/42, respirations
14, satting at 97% on four liters, last gas 7.47, 46, 86, 34,
8 and 97%.  White count 10.9, hematocrit 31.5, platelet count
331,000, INR 1.1, PTT  28, potassium 3.9, BUN 14, creatinine
.5, glucose 141.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to

Date of Birth:   [**2114-2-8**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU/MEDICAL ICU/C-MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man
with a history of stage III squamous lung carcinoma, status
post lobectomy and pneumonectomy on the right earlier this
year, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for respiratory failure.  Two weeks prior to
admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of
shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea.  Echocardiogram and
electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly
unremarkable.

On [**2175-9-17**], after coming home from his son's wedding, the
patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and
collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe.
His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the
field and taken to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital where a chest x-ray was
reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new
left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through
V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which
was new.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] and Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation
and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy, chemotherapy and radiation.
2.  Transient ischemic attack.
3.  Pulmonary embolism.
4.  Atrial fibrillation, on Amiodarone.
5.  Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Negative exercise Thallium test in [**2175-2-26**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
3.  Oxazepam p.r.n.
4.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Neurontin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39, and an older brother status post coronary
artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery
disease and a sister has cardiac valve disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking three months ago
following three to four packs per day times forty years.  He
consumed two to three drinks per day.  He is a construction
worker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 99, heart
rate 70 to 80s, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95%.
In general, the patient was intubated and sedated.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination indicated the pupils
2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally.  Endotracheal tube
is in place.  Cardiovascular - tachycardia with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary examination - The patient had
diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds
on the right.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normal bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm with 1+
distal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies at the outside
hospital indicated that he had a white blood cell count of
11.4, hematocrit 41.0, platelets 466,000.  The differential
on the white blood cell count was 74% polys, 15% lymphocytes,
and 8% monocytes.  Chem7 indicated a sodium of 136, potassium
5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 12,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 285.  Prothrombin time was 22.4,
partial thromboplastin time 37.4, INR 3.0.  Arterial blood
gases indicated a pH of 7.29, paCO2 of 54, paO2 of 506 on a
100% FIO2.  Urinalysis was within normal limits.  CKs were 41
and 57 with a troponin of 0.04 and then 0.6.

Chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no
infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction
with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat CKs.  A Transesophageal
echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and
apical hypokinesis.  The patient was also noted to develop
new onset rapid atrial fibrillation with associated
hypotension and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm but
remained hypotensive requiring pressors.  A CT angiogram was
performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.

On [**2175-9-19**], a PA catheter was inserted which indicated
decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock.  The
patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101
while urine culture grew E. coli.  The patient was started on
intravenous Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Tobramycin and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he
received intravenous fluids and was changed from Levophed to
vasopressin with good effect.  On [**2175-9-21**], the pressors were
weaned.

Bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture
sites with some thick secretions.  On [**2175-9-22**], the patient
was successfully extubated.  Over the weekend of [**2175-9-23**],
and [**2175-9-24**], the patient defervesced with decreasing white
blood count and was successfully switched to oral medications
with stable blood pressure.  His antibiotics other than
Levaquin were discontinued.  The patient was then transferred
to the C-Medicine service for workup of coronary artery
disease.

Cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary
artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex arteries with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.  The patient was
titrated up on a beta blocker ace inhibitor.  Lipid panel
indicated a total cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 137,
LDL of 133 and HDL of 41.  He was therefore started on statin
therapy for hypercholesterolemia.

The patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the
30.0s during his stay in the C-Medicine service and was found
to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, TIBC of 228,
transferrin of 175. These findings were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease and thought secondary to his lung
cancer.

On the C-Medicine service, the patient was noted to have
bilateral carotid bruits.  Carotid Doppler studies were
performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis
and mild plaquing bilaterally.

The patient was maintained on Heparin during his hospital
course and started on Coumadin two days prior to anticipated
discharge with plan to discharge to home on Lovenox until the
patient reached a therapeutic INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

From an endocrine perspective, the patient was treated with
regular insulin sliding scale for his diabetes mellitus with
a plan to transition back to his home regimen of Glyburide 5
mg p.o. q.d.  Fingerstick blood sugar indicated good glycemic
control during hospital course.

A physical therapy consultation was arranged and at the time
of discharge dictation, it was anticipated that the patient
would be deemed safe for discharge to home with outpatient
physical therapy follow-up.

At the time of dictation, the patient was planned to be
discharged to home with VNA.  He was also to follow-up in [**Hospital 191**]
Clinic for an INR check on the day following discharge and
was to follow-up with his primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] firm.
He was to complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin, which
had been switched to p.o. on the day prior to his discharge
in order to treat his urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Urosepsis.
2.  Acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac
catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery
stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex.
3.  Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy.
4.  Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion to normal
sinus rhythm.
5.  Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.

DISPOSITION:  On discharge, it is anticipated at the time of
dictation that the patient will be discharged to home with
VNA and will require outpatient physical therapy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a total course of fourteen
days.
3.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

Date of Birth:   [**2114-2-8**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old
male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer
treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with
saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart
failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently
admitted from [**7-15**] to [**2176-7-19**] for presumed
bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough,
shortness of breath and fevers.  During his last admission
two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day
Prednisone taper and Augmentin for one week.  He underwent
bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial
lesion, which was normal.  Sputum sample was done at that
time showed no growth.  He was discharged at his baseline
function on [**2176-7-19**].  The plan was to treat him for one
week of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for one
week, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks for
pneumonia prophylaxis.  The last dose of Augmentin was
[**2176-7-22**] after being on Augmentin for only three days.

He was doing well until approximately one week ago when he
developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was
due to low potassium.  Within the following days he
complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum.  He
had a low grade temperature, mild headache and worsening
cough and presented to the Emergency Department.  He denied
any sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dysuria or joint pain.  In the Emergency Department
he was febrile to 102 orally and had a heart rate of 160 and
a blood pressure of 118/56.  Respiratory rate 28.  Sating 88
to 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  Initially he was stable, but
then had a gradual change in mental status with hypoxia,
which resulted in his elective intubation.  He received Lasix
100 mg intravenous twice, 1 mg of Bumex and 1 gram of
Ceftriaxone as well as 125 mg of Solu-Medrol.  He was also
placed on a heparin drip for a subtherapeutic INR and given
morphine and Ativan for sedation.  Chest x-ray showed no
focal pneumonia or evidence of heart failure.  The patient
then underwent a CT angiogram of the chest that showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage three squamous cell lung
cancer diagnosed in [**2175-2-26**], status post right
pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**] treated with neoadjuvant
radiation therapy and carboplatin and Taxol.  2.  Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  3.  Congestive heart failure,
last echocardiogram [**2176-6-18**] with limited views showing
grossly preserved left ventricular function and right
ventricular function.  4.  Atrial fibrillation in the
postoperative period.  5.  History of prostate cancer
diagnosed in [**2172-2-26**], status post radical proctectomy
with penile prosthesis in [**2172-8-27**].  6.  Diabetes
mellitus type 2.  7.  History of urosepsis.  8.  History of
pulmonary embolus postoperative in [**2175-6-28**].  9.
Myocardial infarction with a troponin of 4.1 in [**2175-6-28**].  Cardiac catheterization showed 30% right coronary
lesion, normal left ventricular function with an ejection
fraction of 50%.  10.  Transient ischemic attack in [**2165**].
11.  Gout.  12.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.  13.  Sleep
apnea.  14.  Colonic polyps discovered in [**2173-5-27**].  15.
Hypercholesterolemia.  16.  Small pericardial effusion in
[**2176-5-27**], which subsequently resolved.

ALLERGIES:  Doxepin causes delirium and Levaquin causes
prolonged QTs.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Bactrim 800 mg/160 one tablet
twice a day for one week skip one week and then Augmentin 500
mg three times a day.  Potassium 40 milliequivalents twice a
day.  Protonix 40 mg once daily.  Lasix 160 mg b.i.d.,
Uniphyl 200 mg q.d., Zestril 2.5 mg q.d., Serevent two puffs
b.i.d., Flovent 110 micrograms four puffs twice a day.
Combivent inhaler two puffs four times a day.  Duo-neb
solution four times a day as needed.  Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.,
enteric coated aspirin 325 mg a day, Glyburide 5 mg once a
day, Colace 100 mg twice a day, Senna prn, Coumadin 5 mg once
a day except for 4 mg on Tuesday and Thursday, Neurontin 300
mg b.i.d., Oxycontin 20 mg t.i.d., Paxil 20 mg q.d., Lipitor
10 mg q.d., Ambien 15 mg q.h.s. and a regular insulin sliding
scale.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking in [**2175-5-28**]
following a forty year history of smoking three to four packs
a day.  He consumed two to three drinks alcoholic drinks per
day and was a construction worker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39 and an older brother who had a coronary
artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery
disease and he had a sister with cardiac valvular disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This was a gentleman who was
intubated, sedated and responsive only to noxious stimuli.
Pupils were unremarkable.  There were no bruits in the neck.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2
sounds, faint heart sounds overall.  Occasional ectopic
beats. Lungs were clear to auscultation on the left with
transmitted breath sounds on the right.  Abdomen was soft and
mildly distended with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities
showed no evidence of ulcers, trace edema in both lower
extremities and no cyanosis or clubbing.  Skin showed no
evidence of rashes.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  Urinalysis was unremarkable.  White
blood cell count 23, hematocrit 42, platelets were 297.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon admission to the hospital the patient
was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he
was treated for presumed bronchitis versus tracheobronchitis
versus atypical pneumonia.  Blood sputum, urine and stool
cultures were sent and Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin were
started.

1.  Infectious disease:  The patient did not develop a focal
infiltration throughout his hospitalization.  His Ceftriaxone
was stopped and he was continued on Azithromycin.  He
remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay
and his white blood cell count decreased daily.  On hospital
day two he was stable for extubation and tolerated extubation
very well.  He was then transferred on hospital day number
three out of the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor.
He continued to improve clinically with a decrease in his
fever curve and decrease in his oxygen requirements.  He also
subjectively improved and on his last hospital day he was
comfortable and ambulating without oxygen.  He stated that he
had come back to his baseline.  White blood cell count
returned to [**Location 213**] range, and cultures were negative except
for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive
coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge.

2.  Pulmonary:  This was treated as possible
tracheobronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease versus atypical pneumonia.  The patient was kept on
his usual inhaler and nebulizing medications as well as
Azithromycin and intravenous Solu-Medrol.  After hospital day
number two and the patient was extubated and improving the
Solu-Medrol was switched to Prednisone and was rapidly
tapered.  The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was
given regular respiratory treatment and chest physical
therapy.  By the end of the hospitalization the patient felt
that he had returned to his baseline lung function, baseline
pulmonary function and was coughing up less dark sputum.  To
manage his congestive heart failure Lasix was used
judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of
the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily
weights.  The patient responded to this well and felt overall
that his symptoms of volume overload had improved.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Based on his presentation, it was not
clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his
change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent.  Three
sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.  He had a number of electrocardiograms
that were checked to ensure that he did not have a
significantly prolonged QTC interval and that it was not
worse.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was followed with blood glucose
measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor
control with the Glyburide and the regular insulin sliding
scale.  As the regular insulin sliding scale was increased
and the Prednisone was tapered these values returned closer
to normal.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Humibid LA 600 mg b.i.d.  2.
Lasix 160 mg b.i.d.  3.  Potassium 40 milliequivalents po
b.i.d.  4.  Uniphyll 200 mg q.d.  5.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.  6.

po q.d.  25.  Ambien 10 to 15 mg po q.h.s. prn.

The patient had been using Care Group Respiratory Services at
home for pulmonary physical therapy and O2 assistance and so
this was arranged on an outpatient basis, with chest physical
therapy and incentive spirometry and other pulmonary
treatments.  The plan was that he would follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic the following week and that he would have
an INR drawn on [**8-6**] calling the results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

chronic secretions/congestion-related problems, on
alternating regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim since [**2175-9-28**] for multiple bronchitic-like infections, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure,
atrial fibrillation, prior PEs, diabetes type 2, status post
myocardial infarction, who presented with gradual shortness
of breath beginning on the day of admission.

The patient reported a [**1-29**] day history of general fatigue.
On the day of admission, visiting nurse services reported a
systolic blood pressure of 70.  The wife drove the patient to
the Emergency Room.  The patient also complained of some
dizziness, however denied other symptoms including fever,
chills, sweats, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea,
vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  He reported good p.o. intake
and appetite.

The patient reported that he has a chronic, slight cough,
however, denied any sputum production.  He took his oral
temperature at home and denied any fever.  At home, the
patient is on oxygen of [**12-31**] L via nasal cannula.  The patient
recently finished a steroid taper on [**8-14**] which was
two weeks in length.  He reported a usual SBP of 80-110.  The
patient did note that since [**Month (only) 216**], a Scopolamine patch was
added to his regimen and has increased his secretions
significantly.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Per Emergency Room, the patient
appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed
on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2
of 48, and pO2 of 33.  There was a question if this was a
venous gas or not.  Lasix 100 mg IV, Albuterol nebs,
Solu-Medrol 600 mg IV, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV was given to
the patient.  When evaluated by the MICU shortly after
arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down to
baseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% via
nasal cannula.  The patient was breathing comfortably at
18-20 breaths/min.  The patient no longer complained of
shortness of breath but did state that he felt slightly
tired.  Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute
PE.  The patient reported that he was back to baseline in the
Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage III squamous cell lung

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister died at age 39 of cancer.  Brother is
status post coronary artery bypass grafting.  Father with
history of coronary artery disease.  Sister with heart valve

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.5??????, heart
rate 70, blood pressure 89-122/60-77, respirations 19-20,
oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L nasal cannula.  General:  The
patient was in no apparent respiratory distress.  He was
comfortable.  He was alert and awake.  HEENT:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate
and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  Distant heart sounds.
Without murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Loud rhonchi
throughout the left lung field.  No apparent wheezing or
rubs.  Transmitted sounds to right side.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.4, hematocrit 30.0, which is
baseline, platelet count 388; CHEM7 was unremarkable; PT
22.5, PTT 31.3, INR 3.5; B12 327, folate 12.7.

Electrocardiogram unchanged from prior.  Theophylline level
4.3.

Chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung
with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no
pneumothorax, no effusion.  CT angiogram showed no acute PE,
possible chronic PE in pulmonary artery segment in the left
lower lobe that is not occlusive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 62-year-old male with a past
medical history of lung carcinoma status post right
pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 205**]
for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating
antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim, recent
hospitalization in MICU with intubation, chronic secretions,
and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure,
prior PEs, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with
respiratory distress.

1.  Respiratory distress:  The patient was given Lasix,
Albuterol nebs, and Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department
and had rapid improvement of his symptoms.  It was thought
that the patient's acute respiratory distress was most likely
secondary to mucous plugging.  PE was ruled out by CTA.
Chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure
or pneumonia.  The patient also recently completed a steroid
taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this
admission.  He had no cough and no sputum production and no
fevers.  The patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids, as
it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was
unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress
and because it was unclear whether steroids was really
benefitting this patient.

He continued to have aggressive chest physical therapy for
secretion management and was continued on his Scopolamine
patch, Serevent, Combivent, Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, and
inhalers.  He was also continued on his alternating
prophylactic antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim.  He
continued to do well and recorded oxygen saturations of
greater than 92%.  On the day of discharge, oxygen saturation
was 97% on room air.

Of note, the patient was observed in the MICU overnight but
was discharged to the floor quickly and had no other episodes
of respiratory distress.

2.  Hypotension:  The visiting nurse noted a systolic blood
pressure of 70; however, by the time the patient came to the
Emergency Room, he had an SBP of 90.  It was thought that the
patient's slightly decreased SBP was secondary to
hypovolemia.  He was given gentle fluid hydration.  He also
had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal
insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid
taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been
given to the patient.  It was reportedly negative, but it was
unclear as to how accurate this is in the setting of recent
Solu-Medrol dosing.  His Lasix was decreased from 160 mg
b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d., and his ACE inhibitor was
discontinued.  He continued to remain normovolemic during the
rest of his hospitalization.

3.  Cardiovascular:  In terms of the patient's history of
perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and
congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his
Amiodarone and Lasix 80 mg b.i.d.   He also continued Aspirin
and Lipitor.  His electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was
thought that there was not any significant cardiac component
to the patient's respiratory distress.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on his Glyburide
and was covered with an Insulin sliding scale in the
hospital.

5.  History of pulmonary embolus:  The patient was continued
on his Coumadin while in-house.  No further work-up was done.

6.  CODE STATUS:  THE PATIENT IS FULL CODE.

DISPOSITION:  He will be discharged to pulmonary
rehabilitation to try to maximize his pulmonary status.  He
appears to be doing very well with physical therapy during
this hospitalization and has slightly improved his exercise
tolerance.  He will also be started on a Morphine Elixir 5-10
mg sublingually p.r.n. q.6 hours for shortness of breath to
relieve the patient's symptom of air hunger.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Mucous plugging.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hypotension.
5.  Diabetes type 2.
6.  History of pulmonary embolus on Coumadin therapy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will be discharged to
pulmonary rehabilitation.

FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] and his

Date of Birth:   [**2114-2-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, lung cancer, status post right
pneumonectomy in [**2175-1-26**], complicated by pulmonary artery
laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for
oxygen and suctioning who was in his usual state of health
until [**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower
abdominal pain, and projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.
He presented to the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Room on [**2177-11-25**].  At that time he denied
diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, hematochezia and
bright red blood per rectum.  He had dark stools at baseline
secondary to iron use.  The stool was found to be guaiac
positive in the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency
Department also his hematocrit value was 19, down from a
baseline of 31 one month previously and he was coagulopathic
with an INR of 9.8.  Attempts to place a nasogastric tube in
the Emergency Department were unsuccessful.  While in the
Emergency Department, he was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg of
subcutaneous Vitamin K.  The patient was admitted to the
Medicine Floor.  Repeat hematocrit several hours later
dropped to a value of 13.  The nasogastric tube was placed on
the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood.
He was, at that point, transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.  Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh
blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7
cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately
25 cm.  There was no evidence of stigmata of recent bleeding.
He was stabilized with a total of seven units of packed red
blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit
of platelets.  He also received intravenous fluid
resuscitation with normal saline.  Computerized tomography
scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for
diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed.
Colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed
some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and
descending colon.  Internal hemorrhoids were noted but no
stigmata of recent bleeding.  The patient's coagulopathy was
improving.  His hematocrit was stable, and he was transferred
to the General Medicine Floor on [**2177-11-28**].  Of note,
prior to transfer he developed swelling of the right upper
extremity and complained of pain of the right upper
extremity.  Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed
evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data upon admission revealed
complete blood count demonstrated a white blood cell count
19.2, hematocrit 19.0, platelets 381.  Coagulation profile
showed PT 38.5, PTT 38.0, INR 9.8.  Serum chemistries showed
sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 96, bicarbonate 30, BUN
52, creatinine 1.3, glucose 196.  Liver function tests showed
ALT 18, AST 26, amylase 23, lipase 24, albumin 3.4, alkaline
phosphatase 100.  Cardiac enzymes showed creatinine kinase
82, troponin I 0.04.  Chest x-ray was negative for any acute
pulmonary process.  Abdominal x-ray demonstrated
opacification of the right lung base.  The left lung base was
clear.  There was no free air in the abdomen.  There was a
large amount of fecal material in the right colon.  There was
a normal bowel gas pattern.  There was no evidence of
obstruction.  Later computerized tomography scan of the
abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no intra-abdominal abscess,
bowel inflammation, evidence of perforated ulcer,
appendicitis or diverticulitis.  Electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats/minute, normal axis,
prolonged QT interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, T
wave inversions were noted in leads V1 and V2 which were new.
No acute ST elevations or depressions noted.  This was
compared with the prior electrocardiogram from [**2177-10-9**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 63 year old male with
past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in
[**2175-1-26**] complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration,
status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and
suctioning.  He was in his usual state of health until
[**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower abdominal
pain, projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.  His
hematocrit dropped from 31 to a nadir of 13.  His
gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

1.  Anemia secondary to acute blood loss - The patient's
gastrointestinal workup included two
esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one
without source of frank bleed.  However, in light of his
initial complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, and guaiac
positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected.
Physically the small bowel could be the source.  After
stabilization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood
products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was
transferred to the Medicine Floor after having stable
hematocrit for greater than 24 hours.  While on the floor,
his hematocrit was checked initially every 12 hours.  After
demonstrating stability for a total of 72 hours it was spaced
out to q. day hematocrit checks.  All told the patient
received 7 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh
frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital
stay.  On [**2177-12-3**], the patient underwent repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples
of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study.  At
the time of this dictation results of those biopsies were
pending.  While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the
patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether
hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia.  He had a
normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and
bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very
unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19.
Moreover, no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear.
Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his
hospital course and were consistent with changes status post
large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing
hemolysis.

2.  Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - On [**2177-11-28**] the patient began to complain of right upper
extremity pain and swelling.  Doppler ultrasound demonstrated
an axillary deep vein thrombosis.  In light of his recent
bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially.
Although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize
as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was
still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of
the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the
functionality of his one remaining lung.  The computerized
tomography scan was performed to better examine the right
upper extremity soft tissues.  In particular there was
concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass
lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be
contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep
vein thrombosis formation.  Computerized tomographic venogram
was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis,
however.  The patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced
by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in
the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there
was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses.  Therefore,
an inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**2177-12-2**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  On [**2177-12-4**], the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling
of the right lower extremity.  Examination was consistent
with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity.
However, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava
filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the
decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging
of the right lower extremity.  In light of his probable
hypercoagulability, decision was made to reinitiate
anticoagulation with the Coumadin.  His Coumadin level will
be followed by his outpatient physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
His INR should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation
facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a
goal INR of 2 to 3.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma
status post right pneumonectomy - The patient was continued
on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary
toilet.  He was continued on his outpatient medicines,
Combivent, Salmeterol, and Theophylline.  He was continued on
antibiotic prophylaxis with Bactrim Double Strength in light
of his history of bronchiectasis.  He was monitored for acute
decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly
concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper
extremity deep vein thrombosis.  He continued to improve from
a respiratory standpoint.  He was diuresed gently after
arriving to the Medicine Floor status post fluid
resuscitation and blood product administration in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit in the setting of his acute bleed.  With
the diuresis, pulmonary toilet and supportive care, his
respiratory status improved somewhat.  However, he is not
back to his baseline of 2 liters of oxygen nasal cannula at
home.  At the time of discharge he was maintaining
saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he
continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and
shortness of breath, occasionally at rest.  It was felt that
a lot the patient's dyspnea was secondary to muscle
deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital
stay.  Therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary
rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his
conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status.

4.  Diabetes mellitus 2 - The patient was maintained on a
diabetic diet, with q.i.d. fingersticks, fingerstick blood
glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding
scale.  He was maintained on his outpatient dose of Neurontin
for neuropathy.

5.  Atrial fibrillation - He was continued on his outpatient
dose of Amiodarone.  Of note, he is currently in sinus
rhythm.

6.  Acute renal failure - The patient on admission had an
elevated creatinine level above his baseline.  This was
likely secondary to prerenal causes, specifically hypovolemia
and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his
acute bleeding episode.  His acute renal failure resolved
after fluid hydration.

7.  Vitamin B12 deficiency - The patient was continued on his
outpatient regimen of supplementation with Vitamin B12, 1000
mcg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

9.  Depression/anxiety - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Paroxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d.

10.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was fed
a diabetic heart-healthy diet.  He received supplementation
with multivitamins and Vitamin B12.  Electrolytes were
aggressively repleted.  At the time of discharge he was
tolerating regular diet without nausea, vomiting or other
incident.

DISPOSITION:  With the patient's general deconditioning as
well as his pulmonary status being slightly below his
baseline I felt that he would benefit from an inpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation program.  He will be discharged to
such a program.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Hemodynamically stable.  Afebrile.
Oxygen saturation stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula,
ambulating independently, tolerating [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 243**] intake without
nausea or vomiting.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is discharged to an extended
care facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Anemia due to acute blood loss, likely secondary to
gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vitals:  Temperature
98.4, pulse 94, blood pressure 100/65, respiratory rate 18,
sat 96% on room air.  In general, he is well developed, well

149, CK 96, troponin 0.06.

EKG with sinus rhythm at 94 with normal axis; poor baseline;
no other ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old man with multiple
medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia
and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple
polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on
[**2178-1-15**] and represented with lower abdominal pain and
bright red blood per rectum and anemia.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia:  Most
likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and
polypectomy.  Patient had a negative EGD and then had a
colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of
previous polypectomy.  This was clipped with two clips with
good control of the bleeding.

Patient's hematocrit remained stable.  He did receive a total
of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission.
After colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright
red blood per rectum was noted.  Patient's hematocrits were
followed serially and remained in the 26, 27 range and
eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to
discharge, but his hematocrit remained 29 and 31 on day of
discharge.

Otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced
his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he
tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright
red blood per rectum.

Patient was initially started on Protonix 40 intravenously
b.i.d. as his EGD was negative.  Eventually was switched back
to his 40 p.o. q. day regimen which he continued even as an
outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Patient's blood pressure remained stable after transfused
with blood.  He also had a negative tagged red cell scan and
negative EGD.  Eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small
bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as
in his previous admission.  This was also negative.  Patient
could not have a Meckel scan during this stay because of
barium and can have it at least one week after barium
ingestion.

Because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed, patient's
Lovenox dose and Coumadin dose were continued to be held.
Patient's anticoagulation, including aspirin, Coumadin, and
Lovenox, were to be held for at least one week and can be
restarted on [**2178-1-27**] per GI.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient's
respiratory status was stable and at baseline.  Continued his
home regimen of Advair, Combivent, and Theophylline and
p.r.n. nebulizers as needed, although his pulmonary exam
remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of 2
liters and will be discharged on the same regimen.

3.  Status post lung cancer, status post pneumonectomy:  Was
stable with tracheostomy.  Continued b.i.d. suctioning with
good results.  Continue the Scopolamine patch for
antiemetics.

4.  Prostate cancer:  He does have recently rising PSA most
recently 8.9 in 02/[**2177**].  Patient was eventually able to have
a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative
for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony
changes.  Patient will be followed up with urologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 261**], in terms of his prostate cancer follow up.

5.  Troponin leak:  This was attributed to demand ischemia.
He had negative EKG changes, and he had a catheterization in
[**1-/2175**] which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting
disease.  His enzymes remained stable through the course of
his stay and was attributed to his anemia.  Patient's aspirin
was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted
[**2178-1-27**].  Patient was continued on his statin.

6.  Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was in sinus rhythm
throughout the course of his stay and was stable on
Amiodarone.  Again, his Coumadin was held for concerns with
bleeding.

7.  Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus:  He has a
history of [**Location (un) 260**] filter and right upper and right lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis.  His hypercoagulable state
is likely attributed to the prostate cancer, but otherwise
his Coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons, and patient
did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper
and right lower extremity.

Patient was taken off his Lasix dose through the course of
the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability.  Was
given p.r.n. doses of Lasix throughout the stay and continued
to elevate his extremities with good results of them.

Patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds
done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis.  The right lower
extremity ultrasound was negative.  The right upper extremity
did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but
no progression or change from previous studies, and this
otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay.

8.  Diabetes:  He has fairly good control with hemoglobin A1C
most recently at 6.0.  He was continued on his home regimen
of Glyburide once he was taking p.o. and covered with sliding
scale as needed.

For his neuropathy patient was continued on his Tylenol
Number 3 and was discharged with a prescription for Morphine
sulfate per his request, although he was not continued on
this during the course of his stay.

9.  Gout:  This was stable throughout the course of his
admission, but patient was continued on his home dose of
Colchicine.

Brief Hospital Course:

1) Respiratory distress: Improved with face mask. Serial ABGs
showed hypercarbic failure, improved with face mask. Switched to
nasal cannula in PM [**11-18**], but ABGs with ongoing hypercarbia in
the 80s. At night, patient had sub-acute worsening respiratory
status, with desaturation and tachypnea, along with agitation
and confusion. pH with PCO2 in 90s. Placed on CPAP,
unsuccessfully. Repeat ABG with PaCO2 87, pH 7.29. Patient
intubated. Arterial line finally placed successfully. Extubated
on [**11-19**] but extremely anxious and hypertensive and hypercarbic.
Placed on BIPAP and reintubated. [**2178-11-23**] trach placed.  Pt was
stable with the trach and venitilator support.  Pt has been
maintaining stable oxygenation and ventilation on pressure
controlled ventilation with PS 3, PEEP 5, Fi02 0.5, PIP 22, TV
500-600, RR18.
He benefited from albuterol/atrovent nebs, suction, steroids. At
the time of discharge he was on day 4 of prednisone taper.  Pt
was also on Zosyn for GNR, has h/o pseudomonas. No further abx
at the time of discharge.

2) [**Name (NI) 283**] Pt was placed on amiodarone for afib, but this was
discontinued when he developed persistent bradycardia to the
30's-40's on [**2177-11-29**]. Pt was also anticoagulated on a heparin
drip and on [**11-24**] began coumadin loading.

3)bradycardia- likely [**12-30**] amiodarone; resolved after holding
this med ([**2178-11-30**]). pt will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] and will
likely need a Holter Monitor as an outpt. TFT's pending at time
of discharge.

4) agitation: likely due to hypercarbic reso drive, controlled
with haldol and then resolved completely when respiratory status
stabilized.

5) DM: controlled on RISS with standing dose of NPH.

6) FEN: [**Last Name (STitle) 282**] tube placed on [**2177-11-29**] without complication.
Tubefeeds started through the [**Date Range 282**] on [**2177-11-30**].

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year-old male with history of lung cancer post-right
pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Year/Month/Day 282**] placement and
antibiotic course for pneumonia, now returns from [**Hospital **] rehab
with diarrhea, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, and sepsis. No
source of infection had been identified so far. He was C-diff
negative, blood/urine/sputum culture had not yield any organism.
He was treated empirically with ceftazidime, vancomycin and
metronidazole for 7 days. His blood pressure responded to fluid
challenge and he has been normotensive since then. He was
started on stress dose steroid which was weaned off. He was
gradually weaned off ventilation and tolerated trach mask well.

His blood sugar was well controlled with glargine and sliding
scale. He was also noted to have decubitus ulcer. Plastic
surgery was consulted and felt that debridement was not
necessary. Therefore, he was cotinued on wet to dry dressing,
Kinair bed and his nutrition was optimized. He remiained in
normal sinus rhythm and is on coumadin for history of atrial
fibrillation.

He was very agitated in the ICU. He was weaned off fentanyl drip
and put on fentanyl patch. He also was put on standing zyprexa
and prn haldol, morphine. He was also on standing valium and was
actually thought to be in benzo withdrawal as his wife claims
that he was on valium at home.He is full code and his health

for pathologic enlargement.
5. Stable appearance of the superior vena cava which is patent
throughout, but compressed proximally to a slit-like lumen.
5. Chronic occlusion of the left subclavian artery and vein with
numerous vascular collaterals demonstrated within the anterior
chest wall.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 yo man s/p lung ca s/p pneumonectomy and severe COPD
here after prolonged admission for respiratory failure requiring
tracheostomy placement here with new left sided chest pain.
.
1. Chest pain: Multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were cycled and
CK/MB remained flat while troponin increased slightly and then
remained stable at 0.12.  Repeat EKGs showed no changes.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed that there was no evidence
of an acute ischemic event.  Pt was continued on ASA.  The pt's
chest pain may be related to his chronic SVC syndrome.
.
2. Respiratory Failure: Pt on a prolonged ventilator wean
secondary to COPD, pneumonectomy, lung cancer and hx of
recurrent pneumonias.  Pt was continued on AC at night and
pressure support during the day.  He will continued to wean at
rehab.
.
3. Bilateral upper extremety swelling: This has been chronic
since last admission w/o evidence of DVT.  Pt had another CTA in
the ER that showed no PE but did show a narrowing of the SVC.
Interventional radiology placed a stent in the SVC and over the
next several days, the pt's upper ext swelling improved.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for
most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib
with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own.  Pt was
continued on his coumadin.
.
5. Anxiety: Pt has a long history of anxiety controlled on
fentanyl, morphine prn, haldol. AVOID benzos as pt has
paradoxical response.
*
6. Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease- baseline around
28.  Iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal
TIBC, ferritin.  He was transfused once to [**Last Name (un) 291**] hct>30.
.
7. DM type 2: Pt's glucose was controlled with glargine and an
insulin sliding scale.
.
8. Access: A PICC line was placed by IR when pt was having his
SVC stented.  If this line is not needed, it should be pulled to
decrease infection risk.  It was placed on [**2179-2-4**].

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo man with many medical problems p/w hypotension in the
setting of rapid aitral flutter. Also with a Urinary Tract
Infection.

Assessment/Plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p
right pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Month/Day/Year 282**] [**Hospital **]
rehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and UTI.
.
1. Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to infection from UTI vs.
symptomatic tachycardia.
Responded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control.
Remained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. Of note,
his blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported
that this is a [**Last Name 294**] problem for him.
.
2. Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial
Fibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1
conduction. This initially responded to diltiazem. On hopital
day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with
Electrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem
was stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 3.5 years in the
past, and it had to be discontinued [**10-31**] due to bradycardia
when lopressor was added).  He remained in sinus rhythm for the
remainder of the hospitalization. Plan is continue Amiodarone
400mg TID x 1 week then 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week then 200mg po QD
thereafter.  He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel
blockers.

3. Respiratory Failure:  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of
Pneumonia. Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by
respiraotory. An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained
due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff
leak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to
change the trach to a foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the
future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to
ventilate.  He was continued on PS as tolerated with periods of
rest on Assist Control.
.
4. Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: He was initally started
on ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given
history of heart block to levo, he was changed to Bactrim to
complete a 7-day course for complicated UTI. The Urine Culture
grew Klebsiella which is sensitive to Bactrim.His foley catheter
was discontinued.
.
5.Acute Blood Loss Anemia: His baseline hematocrit was 28-30. He
was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3,
his hematorcit dropped to 19.  due to extensive bleeding from
site of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an
appropriate bump in his hematocrit. He was noted to have [**Known lastname **]
guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive
bleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his
trach/mouth. His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient,
and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for
trace blood.
.
6. Bleeding from Central Line site. He is maintained on coumadin
for Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic.
After IJ placement, he had continued oozing from IJ site leading
to anemia with hct 19.   He was given FFP and vitamin K (0.5 mg
iv) to reverse his coagultopathy. He should be restarted on
coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab.
.
5. Diabetes Mellitis: He was continued on glargine and regular
insulin sliding scale. His sugars were in good control.
.
6. Pain/anxiety/depression:
He was continued on his outpatient doses of Fentanyl
75mcg/q72hours, Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg
tid/prn, and paxil.   His pain is from his scaral decubitus
ulcer.
.
7. Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and
continued on DSD for sacral wound.
.
8. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: He had U/S which showed...
.
9. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: He was given lasix prn to
keep fluid even.
.
10.Code: FULL
.
11. Dispo: Discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab.
.
12. Access: The Right Internal Jugular Vein triple lumen
catheter was not discontinued per [**Hospital1 296**] request. This was
placed on [**2179-3-21**].
------
Outstanding issues on discharge:
1.The pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of
discharge [**3-26**].  Please monitor his INR and adjust dose
accordingly.
2.The pt has a swollen L arm and had U/S on day of discharge to
r/o clot. No read has been given yet. Please call [**Hospital1 18**] to
follow this up. Regardless, he is being restarted on
anticoagulation which would be treatment of choice.

History of Present Illness:
65 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problem including
history of lung cancer post right pneumonectomy in [**2174**], severe
COPD, post tracheostomy and [**Year (4 digits) 282**] placement(respiratory failure
due to pneumonia) recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, now
presenting yet again with hypotension and altered mental status.

Patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from
records. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-26**] after an admission
at [**Hospital1 18**] for a Klebsiella UTI and hypotension. Since his
admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to
the commode with assistance. On [**4-11**], the pt became lethargic
and then gradually unresponsive. On [**4-12**], his BP decreased to
60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. He received
a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his BP to 90/40. He remained
unresponsive during this time. ABG showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an
FiO2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. Of note, pt's triple
lumen was placed [**2179-3-21**].
.
Wife later arrived at the hospital and was able to provide
additional history. She reports that he had been doing very well
until Friday. They were working on weaning him and he was able
to be on the trach mask for 1-2 hours at a time. However, on
Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report. He was
maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend.
Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked "very scared"
and would often stare at the ceiling. He also had periods of his
eyes "rolling back in his head". He was occasionally responsive
to her. She reports that they had been checking ABGs over the
last 24 hours and his CO2 had been elevated. When they changed
the vent settings to decrease the CO2, she felt that he was
slightly less confused. She also notes that he was very
diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen.
The pt's BP has always been very low in his left arm and she
reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to
a skin tear on the right.
.
In the ED, the pt's VS were, 99.8 85 80/60-L 150/80-R 20 100% AC
400/20/100%/PEEP 5. He received vancomyicin and zosyn. Pt was
initially started on levophed for hypotension. However, after
learning that his BP has always been considered to be abnormally
low in the left arm, it was checked in the right and has been
stable in the 120s off of pressors. No new consolidation on CXR.
Normal lactate.

studies:
ECG- Sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute. Nonspecific ST-T wave
changes but no major changes since previous studies.
.
CXR- Stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. Right
lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal
contours toward the right consistent with previous
pneumonectomy. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural
effusion. Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left
lung which appear stable. No new left pneumo or focal
consolidation.
.
Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or
evidence of hydrocephalus. No evidence of a major CVA.

US upper extremity:IMPRESSION:
1) Nonocclusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein.
2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins

Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. The
gallbladder is not distended. There is an 8-9 mm stone located
at the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is
thickened. There are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps
located at the fundus of the gallbladder. No intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The common
duct is not dilated and measures 3 mm. Flow in the portal vein
is anterograde. Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no
focal abnormality.

IMPRESSION: Thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the
gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder. In the proper
clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with
cholecystitis. They are not completely typical for acute
cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening may also be produced
by third spacing of fluids. If there is continued clinical
concern for cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be performed for
further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: CT images of the chest without the administration of
IV contrast.

COMPARISON: [**2176-9-11**] and [**2179-3-21**].

FINDINGS:
Soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right
pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right. There is
no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is a left pleural effusion. The patient is intubated with
a tracheostomy tube. A stent is again identified within the
right brachiocephalic vein. The heart demonstrates coronary
calcifications, but is normal in size. The main pulmonary artery
appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm.

Lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen
scattered throughout the left lung. No specific areas of
cavitation are identified within these nodules. Atelectasis is
also seen at the left lung base. There is no focal consolidation
or pneumothorax. Septal thickening is seen throughout the left
lung field. A small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is
again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the
surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities. However, on
the study from [**2179-3-21**], this nodule was clearly seen and appears
stable dating back to [**2176-9-11**]. The bronchi appear patent to the
segmental level within the left lung.

Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material
within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating
to sludge. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen within the
stomach. The remainder of the visualized portion of the upper
abdomen is unremarkable other than arterial calcifications. The
soft tissues are unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen
throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1) Multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the
entire left lung. These most likely represent aspiration
pneumonia. Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the
CT appearance.
2) Mild CHF.
3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of [**2179-3-21**]
demonstrates stability dating back to [**2176-9-11**].
4) Probable sludge within the gallbladder.
5) Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o man with PMH significant for squamous cell lung CA, type
2 DM, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from
[**Hospital1 **] with mental status change and hypotension.

#ID/sepsis
Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating
blood pressure, lactate 1.3. His blood pressure in the ED was
measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower). His
blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors
were off. Sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas),
blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on
discharge. His decubitus ulcer looks clean. His line was resited
line to the right femoral. Chest CT was consistent with
aspiration pneumonia. He will be continued on zosyn for 14 days.
He remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the
rest of his hospital stay.

#Mental status changes:
His mental status improved with decreasing CO2 and also with
narcan. His CO2 remained well controlled in the hospital and was
at baseline in 70s. CT head was negative. Narcotics was taken
into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes.
Patient's duragesic patch was removed in the ED.

#anemia/coagulation
Patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with IVC filter
and SVC clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on
coumadin. COumadin was taken off 3 days prior to hospital
admission because he had blood oozing from his trach and foley.
In hospital, central line was attempted intially on the right
subclavian but the artery was puctured. His right femoral artery
was also punctured and he did lose a signifcant amount of blood.
The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no
hematoma. He also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which
revealed DVT in left arm for which he was started on heparin
drip. He then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from
arterial line site. Heparin drip was then stopped and he was
given 2 unit of transfusion. His hematocrit had been stable
since then. On discharge, coumadin was not restarted. It should
be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable.
.
#transaminitis
He presented intially with transaminitis likely from
hypotension. LFTS trended down on discharge. RUQ ultrasound was
done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension,
thickened gallbladder. He remained afebrile and has no abdominal
tenderness

#respiratory:
Patient has squamous cell lung CA post right pneumonectomy and
post tracheostomy. During his past admission there was concern
about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to
prevent further tracheamalacia. Possible change the trach to a
foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the future if the cuff leak
is interfering with the ability to ventilate. He remained on
assist control ventilation.
.
# [**Name (NI) 300**] Pt with mildly elevated Na at 148. This is most
likely due to water deficit as he can not drink to replace his
needs. He recieved free water through G tube.
.
# Cardiac
Patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such
complain during this hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes were
unremarkable. He was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone
for atrial fibrillation. He is to avoid beta blockers and
calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia.
.
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Patient was continued on standing 8U glargine and sliding scale
while in hospital.

#Anxiety/pain
Patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at
baseline. He was continues on his outpatient doses of Haldol for
anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. His pain is
from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain. Anxiety has been
severely worsened in the past with ativan. Would avoid further
ativan. Fentanyl patch was discontinued since there was a
concern regarding narcotic overdose. He was on prn morphine.
THis should be adjusted in [**Hospital1 **].

# Sacral Decubitus:
He had Kinair bed

# FEN
Tube feeds was continued with no residual

#access
He had picc line on discharge

#code
OK with pressor, do not resuscitate(confirmed again with family
meeting)

[**2119-5-16**] Upper GI : In this patient status post gastric bypass and
partial gastrectomy with repair
of marginal ulcer, there is free flow of contrast through the
gastric pouch and the gastrojejunostomy. No leak or holdup of
contrast identified in this study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 303**] was admitted to the hospital and examined by the
Bariatric service. He had no abdominal pain but had Dilaudid
prior to his transfer.  His cardiac work up was negative and due
to the finding of pneumoperitoneum on abd CT he was taken to the
Operating Room for an exploratory laparotomy. He had a
perforated marginal ulcer and underwent a partial gastrectomy,
omental patch to ulcer and a cholecystectomy. He tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
His pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA and he remained
hemodynamically stable.
He was subsequently transferred to the Surgical floor for
further management.

Due to his recent surgery and length of time prior to taking
fluids he had a PICC line placed for TPN which began on [**2119-5-14**]
through a right AC PICC line.  This was continued until [**2119-5-18**].
In the interim he had an upper GI on [**2119-5-16**] which showed no
anastomotic leak and he gradually began a stage 1 diet.  This
was slowly advanced over the next 24 hours to stage 3 and he had
no trouble with nausea or fullness.

His abdominal wound was healing well and he was up and walking
independently.  He remained free of any pulmonary complications
post op by using his incentive spirometer.  Roxicet was
effective in treating his incisional pain and he was generally
improving every day.

After an uncomplicated course he was discharged to home on
[**2119-5-18**] and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.

Service:  [**Hospital1 139**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for Parkinson
disease with associated [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia and a long history
of tobacco abuse who was noted with fevers.

The patient was in her usual state of health until two weeks
prior to admission when she developed rhinorrhea.  The
patient and her daughter deny any other symptoms at that
time.

However, on the evening of [**2109-3-12**] the patient
reports that she developed pain in the right side of her
neck.  The following day, she had a temperature to 101 with
continued intermittent right-sided neck pain.  She was again
febrile on the morning of admission and called her primary
care physician for his advise.  He suggested that she report
to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's vital signs
revealed a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart
rate was 75, her blood pressure was 93/46, her respiratory
rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.

A chest x-ray in the Emergency Department showed consistent
cardiomegaly.  An opacity in the right lower lobe with
probable right pleural effusion was identified.  There was no
pneumothorax.  The patient was started on levofloxacin for a
presumed community-acquired pneumonia.  Blood cultures were
obtained.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient reports
that she has "usual" cough productive of scant white sputum.
She has had no recent dental work.  The patient denies ear
pain, tooth pain, sores in her mouth, a sore throat,
shortness of breath, chest pain, and diarrhea.  The patient
does report overall weakness for the last one and a half
prior to admission.  The patient denies sick contacts.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Parkinson disease with associated [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia.
The patient is currently not taking any medications because
of "bad reactions" in the past.
2.  Hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on
admission revealed the patient's temperature was 98.8 degrees
Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 128/70, her heart rate was
74, her respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation
was 95% on room air.  In general, alert and oriented.  She
was in no acute distress.  She was able to talk in complete
sentences comfortably without shortness of breath.  There was
an occasional cough.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  The
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The patient
was edentulous.  The mucous membranes were very dry.  No
lesion in the oropharynx.  The neck was supple.  There was no
tenderness to palpation.  There was no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  First heart sounds and second heart sounds.
Pulmonary examination revealed decreased breath sounds
approximately halfway up the right lung.  Rare left lower
lobe crackles.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There were positive bowel sounds.  There was
no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity examination revealed venous
stasis skin changes.  There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  The dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ bilaterally.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII
were intact.  Strength was [**6-12**] in the upper and lower
extremities bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed her white blood cell count was 26.2, her
hematocrit was 39.8, and her platelets were 264.

blood, pH was 6.5, 0 to 2 red blood cells, and a few
bacteria.  Urine culture was pending.  Blood culture was
pending.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  Within the first few days of her
admission, the patient was treated with levofloxacin for a
presumed community-acquired pneumonia.  However, despite
antibiotic treatment, the patient's white blood cell count
remained elevated in the low 20s.  It did trend down slightly
during this time period.

Throughout the first few days of her admission, the patient
denied any shortness of breath and had an oxygen saturation
in the mid 90s on room air.

On [**2109-3-18**], a posterior/anterior and lateral chest
x-ray was obtained to re-evaluate the patient's presumed
pneumonia.  In comparison to the admission film, the right
lower lobe opacity had increased in size and intensity.
There was a probable right pleural effusion.  There was also
slightly more prominent pulmonary vessels on the right which
were considered to be positional.  The left lung was
relatively clear at that time with minor atelectasis at the
base.

The following day (on [**2109-3-19**]), a chest computed
tomography was obtained to better visualize the patient's
lungs.  This showed a right loculated pleural effusion with
parietal pleural enhancement and several small gas
reflections.  In addition, there was right lower lobe
atelectasis and consolidation and left upper lobe
ground-glass opacities consistent with a second infectious
process.

At this time, a Pulmonary Service consultation was obtained.
Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and ceftazidime.  The
patient was taken to Interventional Pulmonary for placement
of a chest tube on the right to drain the loculated effusion.
Following placement of the chest tube, the patient had a
small amount of hemoptysis in Interventional Pulmonology.  In
addition, her oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on 3 liters
via nasal cannula.  The patient was placed on 100%
nonrebreather with an increase in oxygen saturations to 96%.
At that time, the patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further care.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's oxygen requirement
rapidly decreased.  However, the chest tube did not drain the
pleural fluid as expected.  It was found to not be in a
sufficient pocket of pleural fluid.  Cardiothoracic Surgery
was consulted, but the patient and her family wished to avoid
surgery at that time.

Therefore, on [**2109-3-22**], the patient was called out
to the floor for further treatment with antibiotics.  Her
chest tube was removed.  The patient was treated broadly with
ceftazidime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

A long discussion was held with the patient and her family
regarding the slim possibility of cure of her loculated
infection with antibiotics alone.  However, they continued to
desire to avoid invasive procedures.  They were willing for a
pigtail catheter to be placed in Interventional Radiology to
see if it could drain some of her pleural effusion, and this
was done on [**2109-3-23**].  Fluid continued to drain from
the pigtail catheter over the next several days.  During this
time, the patient's white blood cell count remained elevated
but she was afebrile and had good oxygen saturations on room
air.

However, despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and drainage from
the pigtail catheter, the patient's white blood cell count
was still significantly elevated on [**2109-3-28**] at
22,000.  At that time, the family spoke to the Cardiac
Surgery and decided to proceed with a video-assisted thoracic
surgery.  The patient underwent the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure on [**2109-3-29**].  Following the
procedure, she was initially extubated.  However, in the
Recovery Unit, the patient developed hypotension to a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s requiring treatment with
Neo-Synephrine, acute respiratory distress with desaturations
to the low 90s on face mask, and was eventually reintubated
and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

The patient was successfully extubated in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit the next day (on [**2109-3-31**]).  The
patient was returned to the General Medical floor later that
day and has done well since that time.  At the time of this
dictation, the patient was saturating in the mid to high 90s
on room air.  In addition, her white blood cell count
continued to decrease following the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure.  On [**2109-4-2**] her white blood cell
count was 11.5.  Her chest tube was removed on [**2109-4-1**] without difficulty.

An infectious and cytologic workup had been pursued on the
fluid drained through the chest tube and pigtail catheter.
In addition, specimens were sent during the video-assisted
thoracic surgery procedure.  At the time of this dictation,
the fluid obtained on [**2109-3-22**] grew scant
gram-positive rods.  All other cultures have been negative to
date.  Cytology specimens were negative for malignant cells.
Final report of pleural tissue pathology was still pending.

2.  NECK PAIN ISSUES:  A wide differential was considered on
admission for the patient's right-sided neck pain.  The
patient had the neck pain only she was spiking fevers.  It
was not reproducible on examination.

Two days into the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, her neck pain
resolved spontaneously and has not returned.

3.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  On admission, the patient was
continued on her home dose of lisinopril with good blood
pressure control.  Following the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure, the patient became hypotensive in the
Recovery Unit and required pressors.  However, her blood
pressure quickly returned to a normal range.  She was
re-initiated on lisinopril 5 mg by mouth once per day on
[**2109-4-2**].

4.  DEPRESSION ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
sertraline throughout her hospital course.

5.  PARKINSON DISEASE WITH [**Last Name (un) **] BODY DEMENTIA ISSUES:  This
was stable throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.  The
patient does not take any medications for this condition.

6.  REHABILITATION ISSUES:  Physical Therapy worked with the
patient as tolerated during her admission.

7.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was
maintained on a low-sodium diet.  Her potassium and magnesium
were repleted as needed.

8.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on
subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Pantoprazole for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.  Senna and
Colace for a bowel regimen.  The patient was placed on a
nicotine patch during her admission to avoid withdrawal given
her long smoking history.

9.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  At this time, the patient is do not
resuscitate/do not intubate.  Her family is very involved in
the medical decision making.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to
[**Hospital6 310**].  She is currently saturating
in the mid 90s on room air.  She was afebrile, and her white
blood cell count was trending down.  The patient reported
that she felt well.

.
## GI bleed: Pt's hematocrit has been stable while in house and
no further evidence of GI bleeding.  Etiology could have been
small [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear vs gastritis.  Pt has no evidence of
cirrhosis by physical exam or labs.  He was maintained on IV PPI
twice a day and denied any further GI sx's.  He will be
discharged on once a day oral protonix.  Scope was initially
deferred because of increased risk [**2-16**] his DT's.  He was
scheduled for scope on the day of discharge but refused.
.
## EtOH withdrawal: pt states has had DT's in past.  Initially
placed in ICU for closer monitoring, where he required large
doses of benzodiazapines for withdrawl (hundreds of milligrams
of valium).  He was also started on scheduled haldol, which he
should continue as an outpt.  Psych was consulted who agreed
with this plan.  Thiamine and folate were continued.  He left
the ICU [**4-14**] and tried to leave the hospital twice, each time
requiring Code Purple to be initiated (psych emergency) where he
needed to transiently be restrained to avoid self injury.  By
the time of discharge, the pt was no longer withdrawing and not
delerious.
.
## ARF: BUN/Cr ratio indicate likely prerenal. Elevated bicarb
likely [**2-16**] vomiting. Anion gap likely [**2-16**] ARF as well as
starvation ketosis.  Renal failure and those associated
abnormalities improved with IVF's and nutritional support.  His
K and Mg were aggressively repleted.
.
## Elevated pancreatic enzymes: Lipase/Amylase >2:1 likely
affected by EtOH, however not elevated to a degree sufficient
enough to call true pancreatitis. Likely elevated [**2-16**] vomiting.
Resolved with no sequelae.
.
##HTN: unclear of pt's outpt regimen: started prn hydral for SBP
>160.  His htn was attributed to the unopposed sympathetic tone
of alcohol withdrawl.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o male w/ h/o EtOH abuse, UGI bleed, htn, pancreatitis,
EtOH withdrawal sz presenting w/ EtOH intoxication and abd pain
now with suspected withdrawal seizure requring high benzo doses.


1. EtOH withdrawl:

History of Etoh abuse and withdrawal seizure.  He was
intoxicated in the ED and
had a witnessed seizure in that context.  He received in total
about 100mg of valium while in the ED.  He was transferred to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further monitoring.  He was monitored by CIWA
scale, and required minimal further benzodiazepines.  He
consistently had scores by CIWA scale of 0-2 and had no further
signs/symptoms of withdrawal. He had no further seizures during
his hospital course.

2. Acid-base: Primary hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic
alkalosis likely [**2-16**] vomiting, contraction. AG 22 c/w metabolic
acidosis likely uremic. Lactate wnl 2.2.
These acid/base disturbances, as well as hypokalemia and
hypomagnesemia were all corrected with volume resuscitation and
electrolyte repletion.

3. RLL opacity:

Persistent lung nodule in RLL seen on chest xray.  Initially
started on abx in
ED, but these were d/c in ICU, as there was no clear evidence of
infection.  A chest CT was performed, which demonstrated a 3cm

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o M w/ h/o ETOH abuse, chronic pancreatitis, who presented
with signs and symptoms of ETOH withdrawal

1. ETOH w/d: Presented with tachycardia, hallucinations,
tremulousness. Given 40mg Valium in ED. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and
started on valium CIWA scale. Started on Folate, Thiamine, MVI.
Monitored on telemetry overnight. He had no evidence of seizure
or HD instabilitiy o/n. His CIWA was [**8-23**], mainly based on
agitation and tremulousness, and he recieved an additional 120mg
valium overnight. Early on HD 2 the patient demanded to leave.
It was explained to the patient that he has a high probability
of withdrawal seizure or DT's and that he needed continued ICU
monitoring. The patient reported that he understood this but
still wished to leave against medical advice. He was felt to
have capacity to make this decision since he had no evidence of
delirium and clearly understood his situation and risks
involved. The case was discussed with the on call psychiatry
resident, ICU medicine resident and ICU staff attending.
Therefore the patient signed out AMA on hospital day 2. Prior to
discharge we did have him ambulate around the intensive care
unit and he was able to do this without too much difficuluty,
although he was still a bit tremulous upon discharge. He had no
other evidence of active w/d symptoms.

2. Anion-gap Acidosis: Suspected secondary to ketoacidosis,
likely from poor PO intake. ETOH was negative suggesting against
ETOH related cause. Serum acetone was positive, with a normal
serum osm. His gap closed with IVF hydration.

3. Hypochloremic Metabolic Alkalosis: Secondary to HCL loss from
vomiting. Improved with IVF hydration.

4. Hematemesis: Limited hematemesis early the morning of
admission. He had no further episodes of blood loss and he was
guaiac negative on admission. Hematocrit remained stable
overnight.

5. Abd pain: Suspect secondary to chronic pancreatitis.
Amylase/Lipase unchanged from previous levels. AST/ALT 2:1 in
setting of h/o ETOH abuse. Recent CT ([**4-19**]) negative for liver
or GB dx, only fatty liver.

6. RLL lung mass: Seen on Chest CT from [**4-19**], concerning for
primary lung CA. Has not been worked up further. Not able to set
up follow-up as patient left AMA.

irradiation.  He had progressively deteriorated with
inability to walk being the most troublesome.  He is no
longer able to get his left leg to move when standing and he
feels the left arm is also weaker and his speech is much
worse.  His verbal responses are much slower and he has
significant word finding difficulty.  The pain in the left
leg at times is intense and the Morphine has helped with
this.

Mr. [**Known lastname 349**] is an 89 year old man who presented with several
months of dizziness, thirst, and increased urination and was
found to be hyponatremic with a sodium of 114 on admission.
.
# Hyponatremia:
The patient was treated for hyponatremia with 3% saline solution
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Per the renal consult team
recommendations, the patient was placed on free water
restriction to 1L per day and 3% saline was infused at 40cc/hr
via PICC, with a goal of increasing the serum sodium by [**1-13**]
mEq/hour or <12 mEq/24 hrs. Over this initial 24 hours of
admission the patient's serum sodium increased from 114 to 119.
On day 3 of admission 3% saline solution was discontinued and
the patient was transfered to the floor. The nephrology team
that was consulted initially continued to follow the patient
during this admission and determined that the hyponatremia was
hctz-induced. The patient's serum sodium normalized with the
withdrawal of hctz and an SIADH work-up was not pursued, per
renal recommendations.
.
# Word-finding difficulty:
On initial presentation the patient experienced some
word-finding difficulty that resolved as his serum sodium
normalized. CT of the head was negative on admission. On
discharge the patient was able to converse fluently without any
word-finding abnormalities. The patient will follow up with his
outpatient neurologist.
.
# Anemia:
During this hospitalization the patient's hematocrit remained
stable at 35. Iron studies did not reveal iron-deficiency anemia
and the patient was guaiac negative on fecal occult blood test.
The patient will have outpatient follow up of his anemia.
.
# Home Safety:
The patient met with social worker who offered additional
support services which patient declined. VNA will be sent to
patient's house for home safety evaluation.
.
# Code status:
During this admission the patient stated that he wished to be
full code. The patient did not identify a health care proxy.

Service:  TRA


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Seventy-eight-year-old female
involved in a motor vehicle accident. She was an unrestrained
driver with no loss of consciousness, but was hit by a dump
truck with significant intrusion into the car. She has
complaint of chest pain and systolic blood pressure of 88 and
heart rate of 100 in the field.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Amyloidosis, depression, kidney
stones.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Breast implants 30 years ago, tubal
ligation, left hip replacement, question of kidney stone
surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Prozac.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Two cigarettes per day, 1-2 drinks per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 99.4, heart rate 92,
blood pressure 115/40, respiratory rate 20, and 94% on face
mask. She has a GCS of 15. Pupils were equal and reactive.
Trachea was midline. Heart was regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended. There was gross
hematuria visible. The pelvis was stable, but slightly
tender. Rectal was guaiac negative. Back had some abrasions,
but no step-offs. There were some abrasions of the
extremities, but no gross deformity.

LABS:  White blood cell count is 12.6, hematocrit 24.9,
platelets 241. Chem-7 with a sodium of 142, potassium 4.0,
chloride 110, bicarbonate 19, BUN 39, creatinine 1.3, glucose
114. Amylase is 133. Toxicology screen was negative.

Head CT was negative.

C. spine CT shows C2 fracture through the transverse foramen
bilaterally.

Chest CT showed bilateral small pneumothoraces with bilateral
rib fractures, bilateral pulmonary contusions.

Abdomen and pelvis CT showed a splenic laceration with no
free fluid, blood in the left renal pelvis with blood in the
ureter. There is a small liver laceration and a sacral
fracture as well as left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] small fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the trauma
intensive care unit for close observation. Patient was seen
by the [**Doctor First Name **] service and was recommended to have a
nephrostomy tube placed which was done. There was difficulty
with the initial nephrostomy tube, and interventional
radiology inserted the nephrostomy tube.

Patient was seen by the thoracic surgery service for the
bilateral pneumothoraces. Chest tubes were attempted, but
unable to be passed due to scarring and the lungs cleared.
Patient was seen by the orthopedic spine service as well. It
was determined that the C2 fracture would require a hard
collar for at least 8-12 weeks.

Patient was in the trauma intensive care unit with
hematocrits being followed serially. On the evening of
[**8-2**], patient's serial hematocrits were significantly
altered. Patient dropped her blood pressure, became
hemodynamically stable, and the hematocrit was in the mid
teen's. It was decided at this time patient will be brought
to the emergency room emergently to have an open splenectomy.

Postoperatively, the patient was again brought to the trauma
intensive care unit. We gradually weaned the patient from the
ventilator over the course of the next 15-20 days. Patient
had some sputum samples which revealed some gram-negative
rods for which she was started on levofloxacin. A 14-day
course of that was to be initiated. Patient was started on
nutrition with ProMod with fiber by Dobbhoff feeding tube. A
percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**8-9**]
successfully.

On the last few days in the intensive care unit, patient was
able to wean to a tracheostomy collar. This was tolerated
well. Speech and swallow was done the day of discharge, which
a Passy-Muir valve was not tolerated for extended periods of
time. However, it was felt in due time, patient would be able
to swallow on her own in a relatively short period of time.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Extended care facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post splenectomy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Listed on , but they consistent of

Brief Hospital Course:
ID: Patient has been consistently febrile, initially started on
vancomycin and zosyn for presumed pneumonia, sputum cultures and

blood cultures positive for yeast. She was treated with
meropenam, vancomycin, flagyl, and then on [**8-31**] caspofungin
added. She continues to be febrile. Since [**8-30**] blood cultures
have been negative, sputum continues to grow yeast.

GI: On [**8-29**] she was noted to have rise in her LFT's and
abdominal
tenderness, she was taken to the OR for an exploratory
laparotomy
and found to have an ischemic colonic perforation. R colectomy
and ileostomy placement was performed at that time. She is still

not receiving feeds through the G tube.

Heme: Initially anemic, now hct has been stable in mid-20's.

Neuro: Pt when admitted on [**8-23**] was noted to follow commands and

express pain. She was on her home regimen of paxil for anxiety.
On day of admission she was started on propofol for agitation,
it
caused hypotension and it was weaned. She was at that time noted

to be sedated but still following commands. On [**8-24**] she was
switched to a versed drip. On [**8-26**] she was unarousable, versed
stopped and only given morphine PRN. She was noted on [**8-27**] to
follow commands and "awake and alert." [**8-29**] went to the OR, and
afterwards was treated with propofol and fentanyl. On [**8-30**] she
was noted to have minial movement of her LUE and none of her
RUE,
but moved both lower extremities in response to pain. On [**9-1**]
she
was reported to be "following commands" and responding to
painful
stimuli. She has been on a fentanyl drip until [**9-5**], when she
was
switched to a fentanyl patch. On [**9-7**] fentanyl patch was d/c'ed
and she has only been receiving fentanyl prn dressing changes.
Today, it was noted that despite being off sedation for several
days, she has not been awake or following commands initially
However this status has continues to improve and patient had
remained afebrile on trach trial up to 5 hours, she will need
continued wound care to incision with wet to dry dressing

NDICATION: Low-grade fever and cough.

The lung volumes are low. Allowing for this factor, the heart
size is normal, but demonstrates left ventricular configuration.
The pulmonary vascularity is normal. There is some crowding of
vessels in the lower lung zones likely related to the low lung
volumes. A slightly more patchy area of opacity is seen in the
infrahilar region on the lateral view likely due to crowding of
vascular structures. No pleural effusions are identified.

Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is a
paucity of bowel gas suggesting underlying ascites.

IMPRESSION:
1. Low lung volumes. No definite pneumonia, but repeat study may
be helpful to fully exclude basilar pneumonia on this low lung
volume radiograph.
2. Probable ascites.
.
INDICATIONS: 76-year-old man with renal failure and cirrhosis.

COMPARISONS: Ultrasound from [**2137-2-28**].

TECHNIQUE: Renal ultrasound examination.

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm in length, the left
10.9 cm. Both kidneys appear normal without stones, masses, or
hydronephrosis. There is a large amount of ascites, as seen on
the recent ultrasound as well. The liver is coarse and nodular
consistent with cirrhosis.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Large amount of
ascites.
.
Reason: Please place temporary IJ dialysis catheter on [**2137-3-11**]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please place temporary IJ dialysis catheter on [**2137-3-11**]
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 76-year-old man with cirrhosis of the
liver, status post GI bleed, renal failure, needs temporal
dialysis catheter placement for hemodialysis.

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 379**] [**Name (STitle) **]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**], the attending radiologist, was
present and supervising throughout the procedure.

After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient,
written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed
supine on the angiographic table. The right neck was prepped and
draped in the standard sterile fashion. Ultrasound confirmed the
right internal jugular vein was patent and compressible. A
preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the patient's name,
procedure, and the site. 5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for
local anesthesia. Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge
needle was used to access the right internal jugular vein. A
0.018 guide wire was placed through the needle under
fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in the superior vena cava.
The needle was exchanged for a 4-French micropuncture sheath.
The wire was exchanged for a 0.035 guide wire under fluoroscopic
guidance with the tip in the inferior vena cava. The
micropuncture sheath was removed. The venous access was dilated
by using 12- and 14-French dilators. A 20-cm hemodialysis
catheter was placed over the wire with the tip in the right
atrium. The wire was removed. Two lumens were flushed, and the
catheter was secured with skin with sutures.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no
immediate complications.

During the procedure, two ultrasound films were taken.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 20-cm, temporal
hemodialysis catheter through right internal jugular vein with
the tip in the right atrium. The catheter is ready to use.

varices. Patient was transferred to the MICU on [**2137-3-8**], with
banding of esophageal varices and transfusion of 4u pRBC, now
stable and s/p placement of hemodialysis catheter and has
dialysis intiiated, also received large volume paracentesis with
removal of 1.1 L. His clinical status deteriorated due to
worsening cirrhosis and renal failure, and he was made CMO prior
to transfer to hospice.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure. Patient likely had ARF from
hepatorenal syndrome, triggered by intravascular volume
depletion from large volume paracentesis done several days prior
to admission, with contribution from UGIB during his admission.
Renal ultrasound has been negative for obstruction, urine
electrolytes [**Location (un) 381**] sodium c/w HRS, and urine sediment bland.
Urine eosinophils negative, less concerning for ATN as cause.
Patient received 500cc NS challenge on day of admission, with no
improvement in his renal function.  Patient was initiated on
hemodialysis and received three sessions with minimal
improvement in renal function. He was placed on nephrocaps, and
given octreotide and midodrine for treatment of HRS. He was
given albumin 12.5 mg twice daily. His diuretics were held.
.
#. GI bleeding. Patient had an episode of coffee grounds emesis
in the ED, with hx Grade II esophageal varices. He again had an
episode of upper GI bleeding while on the floor, and was
transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU, the patient received 2 units of blood and underwent
gastric banding for variceal bleeds.  He was continued on
octreotide gtt for 5 days and started on carafate. After the
banding, pt did not develop any further hematemasis, however, pt
received two more units for hct drop.  He was started on full
liquid diet. He was then transferred to the floor, where he was
stable for the next several days. He had an active T&S, and was
on protonix and carafate, scheduled for repeat endoscopy two
weeks later. On day prior to discharge, patient again started
vomiting up guaiac positive material. KUB showed an ileus, with
likely vomiting of feculent material mixed with blood. There was
no indication of active bleeding.

#. Scrotal edema. Patient c/o pain and tenderness at Foley
insertion site, and his foley was discontinued. He was not
having any urine output and received intermittent straight
catheterizations with minimal urine output. These were
discontinued as well due to patient discomfort. Bladder scan was
not reliable for urine in bladder due to increased ascites.
Patient's pain was controlled with morphine, viscous lidocaine,
and scrotal elevation with warm packs.
.
#. Cirrhosis [**1-31**] NASH vs. PSC. MELD score calculated at 32.
Patient received diagnostic paracentesis for SBP which was
negative, with final cx showing no growth, and was placed on SBP
prophylaxis with levofloxacin. He also received a large volume
paracentesis wtih removal of 1.1L . His nadolol was held. He had
a fluid restriction of 1500cc/day and his I/Os were monitored
closely. He was given lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. His
spironolactone and furosemide were held due to concerns over
hypotension. He was continued on ursodiol. Liver consult
followed the patient throughout his hospital stay. He was given
Vit K SC for his coagulopathy.

#. Hyperkalemia. Likely [**1-31**] ARF. His hyperkalemia resolved with
kayexelate and dialysis.
.
#. Diabetes type 2. Patient was continued on home insulin
regimen until decision was made to make patient CMO.
.
#. PPx. Incentive spirometer. Senna/colace. PPI.
.
#. Code status: Patient was made CMO. A palliative care consult
was obtained. He was given a fentanyl patch with morphine elixir
for pain, and given ativan and dolasetron as well. He was
discharged to hospice.

Chief Complaint:
Transfer for respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PA catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 399**] is a 69 year-old female with a history of
diabetes, coronary artery disease, COPD who presents on transfer
for respiratory distress.
.
Per review of OSH records:  Patient presented to OSH with
complaints of [**2-7**] days of cough and dyspnea.  On the day prior
to transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset
of worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by
the time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a
pulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.
.
At the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She
was given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several
hundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,
requiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  For a
possible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She was transfused one unit of pRBC for a hct of 29.  An echo
done at the OSH showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly
preserved LVEF.
.
In speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six
months the patient's asthma has been under excellent control.
She was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  It was
felt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home
environment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over
the last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought
to her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes
had contained mold and were the precipitant for her current
exacerbation.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN [**10-24**]:
69 female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease,
diabetes who present with respiratory distress, NSTEMI, acute
renal failure, currently vented.
.
1. Respiratory failure:
Pulmonary Dysfunction/Reactive Airway Disease: The most likely
etiology of the precipitating event in this patient is a severe
exaccerbation of her known reactive airway disease. Regarding
precipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing
and could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they
represent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other
more typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,
PE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and
vented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the
ventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due
to vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.
Patient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the
continued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due
to demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory
hold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive
bronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she
continued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial
sedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the
ventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was
causing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After
episode [**10-22**] patient required paralysis.  [**10-23**] patient
esophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a
need for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient
tolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped
paralytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged
expiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period
and CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back
on paralytics. While paralyzed [**Last Name **] problem with lung resistence.
Attempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to
wean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision
was made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of
her hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.
During this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent
arrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required
ventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care
and ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac
failure.
.
2. NSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.
At OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 0.6, felt to be
demand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was
stopped [**10-20**].  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest
pain.
Here [**10-21**] O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.
Tachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend
down in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,
Troponin 1.26). On [**10-23**] O/N patient weaned off sedation, became
agitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time
on the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG
sinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating
concordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to
[**10-22**]. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT <30. She
was continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and
metoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.
.
3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes
of desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean
sedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. [**10-21**],
patient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.
Patient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and
hypotension(toponin [**10-23**] 1.26). Demonstrated during this that
patient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia
causing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID
and diuresed as tolerated.
.
4. Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient
afebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.
In the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious
for PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent
NSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs
alternative sources for infection. [**Month (only) 116**] also be due to increased
steroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH
negative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.
.
5. Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:
Was quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at
[**Hospital1 18**] insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal
limits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for
patient pulmonary disease.
.
6. Acute renal failure: At baseline.
Most likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with
renal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 15.6% suggesting
pre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel
patient at baseline (1-1.5).
.
7. Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved
Patient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant
amount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for
bicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave
back bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb [**10-22**] am.
Patient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps
bicarbonate [**9-21**].
.
8. Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be
diuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with
hypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Hypotension with
intubation. Hypotension [**10-21**] O/N. Hypotensive [**10-23**] O/N in
setting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved
with decreased in PEEP from 18-14.
.
9. Tachycardia:
Reoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.
On admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to
pain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  [**Month (only) 116**] be
component of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation
and IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic [**9-21**]. Only
concern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress
in relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point
low suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.  She was
given metoprolol for rate control.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 403**] is
a postoperative admission who was admitted directly to the
operating room for mitral valve repair versus replacement.
She was seen in preadmission testing prior to surgery.  At
that time, her chief complaint was occasional dyspnea on
exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47-year-old woman with
known mitral regurgitation followed by electrocardiogram.
Cardiac catheterization done showed 3 to 4+ mitral
regurgitation with normal coronaries and an ejection fraction
of 67%.  Cardiac echocardiogram done in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year
showed an ejection fraction of 60% with mildly enlarged left
atrium.  No aortic insufficiency.  There was 3+ mitral
regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral valve prolapse.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Varicosities of the lower extremities (left greater than
right).

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   No past surgical history.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Levoxyl 50 mcg by mouth once per
day.

ALLERGIES:   The patient states no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband and two children.
Occupation as a writer.  She denies tobacco use.  Occasional
alcohol use.  Denies any other drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Her mother is alive.  Her father is alive,
status post mitral valve repair.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her height was 5 feet
3.5 inches, her weight was 130 pounds.  In general, she was
well-appearing and in no acute distress.  The skin was
unremarkable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The extraocular movements were intact.  The sclerae were
anicteric.  The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
There was no jugular venous distention.  There were no
bruits.  The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  First heart sounds and
second heart sounds.  There was a 3/6 systolic ejection
murmur that radiated throughout the precordium.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were positive
bowel sounds.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly or
costovertebral angle tenderness.  The extremities were warm
and well perfused.  There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  Varicosities bilaterally (left greater than right).
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII were grossly
intact.  A nonfocal examination.  The pulses revealed 2+
femoral bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally,
and 2+ posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally, and 2+ radial
pulses bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 5.7, her hematocrit was 33.2, and her
platelets were 199.  Her INR was 1.1.  Sodium was 136,
potassium was 3.5, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 25,
blood urea nitrogen was 8, creatinine was 0.5, and blood
glucose was 92.  Liver function tests were within normal
limits.  Urinalysis was negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 57 beats per minute.

A chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary processes.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously, the
patient was a direct admission to the operating room on [**4-1**] where she underwent minimally invasive mitral valve repair
via a right mid axillary mini-anterior thoracotomy with a
28-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] angioplasty.  Please see the Operative Report
for full details.

In summary, the patient had a minimally invasive mitral valve
repair.  Her bypass time was 130 minutes with a cross-clamp
time of 110 minutes.  She tolerated the operation well and
was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient's
mean arterial pressure was 74 with a central venous pressure
of 6.  She was in a sinus rhythm at 89 beats per minute.  She
had a Levophed infusion at 0.3 mcg/kg per minute and propofol
at 20 mcg/kg per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  She had no other
events on operative day.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to require a
Levophed infusion for blood pressure support which was
titrated as tolerated.  Her Swan-Ganz catheter was removed on
postoperative day two.  The patient had weaned to off the
Levophed infusion, and she was transferred to the floor for
continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Additionally, on postoperative day two, the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**]
drain was removed.  Over the next several days, the patient
had an uneventful hospitalization.

Once on the floor, with the assistance of the nursing staff
and the Physical Therapy staff, the patient's activity level
was advanced.  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her hospitalization.

On postoperative day four, it was decided that the patient
was stable and ready to be discharged to home.  At that time,
the patient's physical examination was as follows.  Vital
signs revealed her temperature was 99, her heart rate was 92
(sinus rhythm), her blood pressure was 104/68, her
respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on
room air.  Her weight preoperatively was 59 kilograms, at
discharge was 66.7 kilograms.

Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 7.7, her
hematocrit was 23.1, and her platelets were 129.  Sodium was
137, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 31,
blood urea nitrogen was 8, creatinine was 0.5, and her blood
glucose was 99.

Physical examination revealed she was alert and oriented
times three.  She moved all extremities.  She followed
commands.  Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  First heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
The extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Right thoracotomy incision with
Steri-Strips, opened to air, clean and dry.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg every day.
2.  Niferex 150 mg mouth once per day.
3.  Vitamin C 500 mg twice per day.
4.  Toprol-XL 12.5 mg once per day.
5.  Levoxyl 50 mcg by mouth once per day.
6.  Colace 100 mg twice per day.
7.  Lasix 20 mg once per day (times two weeks).
8.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq once per day (times two weeks).
9.  Dilaudid 2 mg to 4 mg q.4-6h. as needed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post minimally invasive mitral valve repair via a
right thoracotomy.
2.  Hypothyroidism.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged home
with [**Hospital6 407**].

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Atorvastatin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Transesophageal echocardiogram
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 426**] is an 80yo woman with h/o CAD s/p recent PCI, severe
AS s/p valvuloplasty [**4-/2174**], and recently treated for possible
pneumonia with ceftazidime [**Date range (1) 427**] admitted with shortness of
breath and hypotension.

Ms. [**Known lastname 428**] husband reports that he has observed her breathing
very fast around 3 or 4 in the morning for the last couple of
nights.  On the day of admissin, she woke up short of breath and
breathing quickly.  He used a stethoscope (which he has to help
with home maintenance) and heard a hissing/wheezing on her right
chest, which prompted him to call 911.  She continued breathing
fast until she was intubated in the ED with her consent.  He
notes that she has had a minimally productive cough since her
last admission, though she has not had fevers or chills.  She
had diarrhea for about a day recently, but this has resolved.
Her nephrologist contact[**Name (NI) **] her on [**6-16**] and advised her to
decrease her lasix from 160mg daily to 80mg because of her
rising creatinine.  Despite this change, her daily weight has
remained stable at 119-120 pounds.  She has been compliant with
1L fluid restriction.

In the ED, her initial VS were:  99.8   115   122/75   30s   82%
NRB.  She was noted to have crackles on her pulmonary exam.  She
was given rocuronium, etomidate, and versed and intubated
urgently.  Shortly after propofol gtt was started, she dropped
her pressures into the into the 70s (per report; recorded in the
80s).  Bedside Echo was done to evaluate for concern of
tamponade.  Echo demonstrated large anterior fat pad and stable
small loculated pericardial effusion.  Left cordis was placed
for hypotension; there was concern that the line might be in the
carotid, and CT was done to confirm placement.  Radiology
reports that the line is in the left brachiocephalic vein.
Pressures increased to 110s after 500cc IV fluid bolus.  She
received vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  +3 pillow
orthopnea, although she tends to move to flat position during
sleep.  She does not sore and her husband denies witnessed
apneas, though she has never had a formal evaluation.

UA negative

ABG 7.36/46/74 after intubation

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 122 with LBBB with no
significant change compared with prior dated [**2174-6-6**].

TELEMETRY demonstrated:  Sinus tachy at 106

TTE [**2174-6-19**]:
The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF<20 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is a small, primarily anterior
pericardial effusion most prominent around the right atrium and
right ventricle with a prominent anterior fat pad. No right
atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen (may be
absent in the setting of pulmonary artery hypertension).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-30**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly larger (but without
hemodynamic compromise) and left ventricular systolic function
is more depressed.

CXR [**2174-6-19**]:
A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the right
atrium.
An endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina. A
nasogastric tube
terminates past the stomach with its tip outside the plane of
imaging.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is
increased
perihilar haziness with interstitial fluid that is mostly
central. There is also increased peribronchial cuffing. There is
no evidence of pleural
effusion. Moderate S-shaped scolisosis is noted.
IMPRESSION: Acute central pulmomary edema.

CXR [**2174-6-19**]:
Newly inserted nasogastric tube projects over the stomach. The
tip
of the endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina. The size of
the cardiac
silhouette and the bilateral parenchymal opacities show no major
change.

CT Chest without contrast [**2174-6-19**]:
1. The left IJ introducer sheath is terminating in the proximal
left
brachiocephalic vein without immediate post-procedure
complications.
2. Diffuse bilateral septal thickening and ground-glass
opacities with
associated small bilateral pleural effusions suggesting moderate
pulmonary
edema. Bibasilar atelectasis and coexistent pneumonia cannot be
excluded and should be clinically correlated.
3. Comparative evaluation of pulmonary nodules is limited due to
respiratory motion and diffuse background pulmonary edema.
Further evaluation for stability should be undertaken post
resolution of background pulmonary edema.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic aortic valvular and coronary
calcifications are unchanged.
5. Large axial hiatal hernia.
6. Stable small pericardial effusion.

TTE [**2174-6-23**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. LV systolic function appears depressed. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is at least moderate aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Significant aortic stenosis,
mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, depressed LV function.

CT Head w/o contrast [**2174-6-26**]:
1. Focal region of hypoattenuation within the right anterior
limb of the
internal capsule. Etiology of this finding is unknown as well as
duration and differential diagnosis includes an old lacunar
infarct versus new region of ischemia. Further evaluation may be
obtained with MRI including diffusion- weighted imaging sequence
to evaluate for acute ischemia.
2. Probable old lacunar infarction within the right corona
radiata.
3. Bifrontal lobe cerebral atrophy.
4. Moderate confluent periventricular white matter chronic
ischemic changes.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] w/o contrast [**2174-6-27**]:
There is no evidence for acute ischemia or acute hemorrhage.
There are scattered small vessel ischemic sequelae in the
subcortical and
periventricular white matter. There are old lacunes in the right
anterior
limb of the internal capsule. The ventricles and sulci are
prominent but
likely age appropriate.
There is focal prominence of bifrontal extra-axial spaces which
may suggest focal volume loss in the bifrontal lobes. There is
no hydrocephalus.
Intracranial flow voids are maintained.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates patency of the anterior
and posterior circulations. There is stenosis within the limits
of this exam. There is a hypoplastic right A1 segment. The right
vertebral artery is relatively hypoplastic. There is a possible
3-mm aneurysm on the left at the junction of the cavernous and
supraclinoid ICA. Additionally, there is a possible 2-mm
aneurysm of the supraclinoid ICA posteriorly in close proximity
to the ICA bifurcation.


Brief Hospital Course:
80yo woman with severe AS, CHF, CRI, admitted with respiratory
failure likely [**1-15**] acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure.
She was diuresed with Lasix, improving her respiratory function
to the point where she no longer required supplemental oxygen,
but subsequently developed CRAO, leading to stroke workup and
anticoagulation with heparin, leading to GIB due to esophagitis
and gastritis, leading to transfusion for dropping hematocrit,
leading to acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to
volume overload.
.
# Respiratory failure [**1-15**] acute on chronic heart failure:
Presented in respiratory distress with SaO2 82% on NRB.
Respiratory failure most likely multifactorial, involving
chronic heart failure due to aortic stenosis, exacerbated
acutely by volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of
decreased Lasix dosage. Intubated in ED, extubated on hospital
day 2. Continued to require 4LNC, desaturating to 80s on room
air. Diuresed with multiple boluses of Lasix IV. Gradually
weaned to room air, with O2 saturation in mid to high 90s while
resting, but desaturating deeply to upper 80s with ambulation.
Unfortunately, she subsequently developed a GIB, leading to
transfusion of multiple units of PRBCs, resulting in shifts in
volume status and worsening oxygen saturations and increasing
need for supplemental oxygen. She was once again diuresed with
multiple doses of Lasix IV, at times requiring combination with
metolazone. She was gradually weaned off of oxygen until she no
longer required supplemental oxygen and was euvolemic on exam.
.
# GIB:
Vomited a large quantity of blood after starting heparin. Has a
history of gastritis on recent admission in [**2174-5-15**]. GI was
consulted and EGD done, showing gastritis and esophagitis but no
frank bleeding. She was started on an IV PPI and antiemetics.
She was initially transfused two units of blood in the setting
of the acute bleed, and subsequently received another unit for
gradually decreasing hematocrit. Of note, even before her
episode of acute GIB, her stools were noted to be guaiac
positve. GI felt that given that the GIB occurred in the setting
of being started on heparin and having a previous history of
gastritis, there was no need to arrange for GI follow up unless
she desired.
.
# Central Retinal Artery Occlusion:
Awoke one afternoon with sudden loss of vision in R eye.
Ophthalmology was consulted and diagnosed patient with likely
CRAO. Paracentesis was performed to lower intraocular pressure.
Neurology consulted for stroke workup. CT and MRI showed signs
of old ischemia and infarction but no acute events. Started on
heparin drip for concern about emboli, but heparin discontinued
for GIB. Carotid ultrasound showed thrombus in L IJ, possibly
related to recently removed Cordis, but otherwise no significant
stenosis. An appointment was made for her to follow up with a
retinal specialist. Of note, she reports that she is already
followed by a retinal specialist at the MEEI for her macular
degeneration.
.
# Aortic Stenosis:
Currently s/p recent valvuloplasty, with valve area 0.9cm.
Evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery - felt to be poor surgical
candidate, both for valve replacement and for apico-aortic
conduit, given significantly calcified aorta, small body habitus
and poor renal function. Cardiothoracic surgery recommended
considering enrollment in percutaneous valve trial.
.
# Renal Failure:
In consultation with renal team, it was felt that it was
necessary to diurese the patient in order to improve her
pulmonary status. Baseline Cr 1.3-2.5 over last month.
Creatinine increased to 2.7 initially, but subsequently improved
with continued diuresis. HD line removed on hospital day 2 for
gram positive cocci on blood cultures (she required hemodialysis
in [**Month (only) 116**], but has not required it since). The patient was diuresed
to a creatinine of 2.4 on the day of discharge so that she would
be slightly dry on discharge and therefore euvolemic on her home
diet.
.
# Infection:
Initial ED blood culture grew Viridans streptococcus, resistant
to penicillin. HD line tip culture grew staphylococcus aureus,
resistant to oxacillin, sensitive to vancomycin. Pt was treated
with vancomycin starting in the ED. Per infectious disease
consult, due to possibility of endocarditis (absence of
vegetations on TEE did not rule out endocarditis), given blood
culture with Viridans streptococci, the pt will require
treatment with 6 weeks of vancomycin for Viridans streptococcus.
She will require vancomycin, dosed for troughs of under 20,
until [**7-31**]. A PICC line was placed for administration of
antibiotics to treat possible endocarditis.
.
# Anemia:
Hct gradually decreased from near 30 to 20.1 in first day in
CCU.  Transfused two units PRBCs to post transfusion hematocrit
26.5. Has h/o diverticulosis and gastritis. Stools guaiacs were
positive. Subsequently transfused two units immediately
following GIB, and then another unit for gradually decreasing
hematocrit. Hematocrit was stable at 32 on discharge.
.
# Mobility:
Evaluated by physical therapy. Will receive PT at home.

.
Secondary Diagnoses:
Aortic stenosis
Coronary artery disease
Pulmonary edema
Chronic renal insufficiency
Hypertension
Anemia with chronic GI bleed
Scoliosis


Discharge Condition:
Stable vital signs with appropriate follow-up.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with acute respiratory distress due to fluid
in your lungs. When you initially presented, you required
intubation and mechanical ventilation to provide you with
adequate oxygenation.

Your aortic stenosis (which is the narrowing of one of your
heart valves) makes it very difficult to manage your fluid
status. You were evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery to see if
they would suggest replacing your aortic valve, but they felt
that you would not be a good candidate for surgery because of
your other medical conditions, which would make surgery
extremely risky.

You were treated with Lasix to decrease the amount of fluid in
your lungs, improving your ability to breathe. Your ability to
breathe gradually improved to the point that you did not require
supplemental oxygen.

You developed a loss of vision in your right eye. You were seen
by an ophthalmologist who made a small hole in your eye to drain
some fluid and diagnosed you with likely central retinal artery
occlusion, a condition in which a vessel supplying blood to the
eye becomes clogged. You were started on anticoagulation with
heparin.

You developed a gastrointestinal bleed, vomiting a quantity of
blood and having a number of maroon colored stools. You were
seen by a gastrointestinologist who performed an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, showing esophagitis and gastritis.
Heparin was discontinued and you were started on IV proton pump
inhibitors.

A sample of your blood showed that you had an infection in your
blood with a bacteria known as Viridans streptococci. You were
initially started on ceftriaxone, an antibiotic, to treat this
bacteria. Because the particular bacteria you were infected with
turned out to be resistant to penicillin, the ceftriaxone was
discontinued and you were treated with vancomycin. You will
require treatment with vancomycin for a total of six weeks,
until [**7-31**]. A PICC line, a special type of IV line, was
placed so that you can continue to receive the vancomycin at
home.

Your hemodialysis catheter was removed. Because you had not
required dialysis recently, it was felt that the catheter was
not necessary. The tip of the cathether was noted to have
another type of bacteria on it, Staphylococcus aureus. This
bacteria was resistant to many antibiotics and required
treatment with vancomycin. You were treated with vancomycin for
the Staphylococcus aureus. This infection required only
treatment for 5-7 days, so this bacteria has probably been
adequately treated already.

When you first were admitted to the hospital, your kidneys were
functioning poorly. Your creatinine, which increases when your
kidneys are not working well, reached a peak of 2.7. As we
treated you with Lasix and decreased the amount of fluid in your
body, your kidney function actually improved.

You were noted to be somewhat anemic. When you first came in,
your hematocrit was near 30. It gradually dropped to
approximately 20.  You were given two units of blood, and your
hematocrit increased to the upper 20s. Subsequently, your
hematocrit dropped again after you had your GI bleed. You were
again transfused two units of blood. A few days later, your
hematocrit was noted to trend down, so you were transfused
another unit.

1. Please take all medications as prescribed.
***Medication Changes:***
Your aspirin was changed to 81mg daily. Your carvedilol was
increased and your prilosec increased to twice daily. Your
Cozaar is being held because of your renal function. Vancomycin
was started to treat bacteria in your blood. Sevelamer was
started to regulate the phosphate level in your blood as your
kidneys are not working as well to remove it.

2. Please attend all follow-up appointments listed below.

3. Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you
develop chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness,
decreased urine output, or any other concerning symptom.

4. Please weigh yourself every morning and call your doctor if
your weight goes up by 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.

5. Please limit yourself to a 2 gm sodium diet; written
information was reviewed with you about your diet.

6. Please limit your fluid intake to a fluid restriction of
1000mL/day.

7. While you are on the vancomycin, you will need to have weekly
labs drawn and faxed to the infectious disease doctors [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted with presumed CHF exacerbation most likely
secondary to increased dietary salt intake and severe aortic
stenosis. Pt was diursed and treated with O2.


CHR Exacerbation:
Patient was diuresed.  She was initially started on antibiotics
for question on pneumonia which were then stopped after her
white count normalized.

She was continued on her IV vancomycin course which was started
at a previous hospital stay for strep viridans bacteremia. She
was afebrile for the duration of her stay.  The patient was
diursed and treated with oxygen and improved.  Pt has prior hx
of GI bleed and had heme positive stools.  Her hct remained
stable throughout her hospitalization.  She received 2 units of
PRBC for a hct of 23, which was later determined to be near her
baseline of 25.

She was discharged in stable condition to home with home oxygen
as she had ambulatory desats to 87%.  She has follow with her
PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 444**] of her vancomycin levels and follow with with
GI for colonoscopy.  She was also instructed to follow up with
her cardiologist for managment of congestive heart failure and
her neprologist for her kidney failure.

Her carvelilol was increased to 21.5mg twice a day and her
neurontin was changed to 300mg every other day.  She was resumed
on all her other home medications.

Coronary artery disease:
Pt with history of CAD and has had presious stent.  Her cardiac
enzymes were negative and there were no ECG changes.  Her ACE-i
was held in the setting of her acute renal failure, she was
continued on her Aspirin and beta blocker.

Aortic Stenosis:
Her severe aortic stenosis was thought to be a contributing
factor to her current CHF exacerbation.  She has had a past
valvuloplasty and was determinted not to be a candidate for any
further intervention at this time

Strep viridans bacteremia:
She had a rencent echocardiogram that was negative for
endocarditis.  Her blood cultures were negative for her length
of stay.  She remained on Vancomycin.

GI bleed: Pt had guiac positive, melanotic stools.  She remained
on her PPI and was set up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] as an outpatient for
colonoscopy.

Renal Failure: Baseline Cr appears to be close to 1.6 but her Cr
has been fluctuating up to 2.7 on prior admission. She continues
to have good urine output and her cr trended down.

[**2174-8-1**]: Upper GI Endoscopy - According to the GI Fellow, they
had found several bleeding AVM's at the Gastric and Duodenal
border similar to an endoscopy done a month prior.  GI was able
to cauterize 3 of the AVM's.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 80yo woman with h/o CAD s/p recent DES to LCX and AS
s/p valvuloplasty admitted on [**7-22**] for another CHF exacerbation,
receiving diuresis/HD, pt course was complicated by GI bleeding,
underwent dialysis prior to leaving.  It was decided that the
patient was not a candidate for surgical intervention of the
stenotic valve at this time.
.
# CHF Exacerbation: The patient had several episodes of
desaturation and acute shortness of breath.  The patient was
given progressive doses of lasix, typically IV at 100mg.  She
became refractory to Lasix dosing and required priming with
diuril.  The patient was transferred from CCU to the floor, at
which point she developed both acute shortness of breath and
progressive hematemesis which prompted her return back to the
CCU.  She developed renal failure shortly thereafter, and
required hemodialysis.  After frequent dialysis, the Pt. is now
satting at 98% on 4L and is fairly comfortable.
.
# Coronary artery disease: DES to LCx in [**2174-5-11**], other
coronaries w/o obstructive dz. No evidence of acute ischemic
changes during admission.  The patient had been receiving ASA
and Plavix along with carvedilol, the ASA and plavix were
discontinued after the episode of upper GI bleeding.
.
# Aortic Stenosis: s/p valvuloplasty, not thought to be good
surgical candidate due to large atheroma.  No realistic
percutaneous option as patient has 4 exclusion criteria for most
feasible trial.  Last TTE [**7-27**] w/aortic valvular area of 0.5
cm2.
.
# ID Issues: Pt recently ended course of Vancomycin for strep
veridins bacteremia.  Blood and Urine cultures have been
negative, TTE negative for any endocarditis.  Urine cultures
negative with postitive UA.  The patient had her foley removed
and she completed a course of cipro for 5 days.
.
# Upper GI Bleed: The patient devleped retching and hematemesis
on [**8-1**], which was similar to an episode a month earlier.  At
that time she was scoped and found to have multiple bleeding
AVM's which were cauterized and had a stable Hct.  At this time,
the patient was found to again have multiple AVM's which were
bleeding.  The patient was transferred back to the ICU after a
hematocrit drop of over 7 to 19, was given 3 units of blood.
She summarily went into flash pulmonary edema with concomitant
renal failure, and had to be dialyzed.  The patient was given 1
more unit of blood and placed on Epo before discharge, Hct has
been stable at baseline of 26 for the 48 hours prior to
discharge.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  The patient had been
responsive to high doses of lasix (100mg) with diuril priming.
However, when the patient developed hematemesis and had an acute
blood loss, she subsequently developed renal failure, and when
she had a subsequent episode of flash pulmonary edema, she
received urgent dialysis and a tunnelled HD line was placed.
She received dialysis prior to discharge, and had been followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 80 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p cypher DES to LCX [**2174-5-13**],
severe aortic stenosis with valvular area of 0.5 cm2 despite
recent aortic valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-11**], frequent
hospitalizations for CHF exacerbation (last d/c [**2174-8-5**]), and
ESRD recently restarted on HD who returns w/SOB. She was
admitted on [**2174-7-22**] for CHF exacerbation and discharged
yesterday. She was initally treated with Lasix, went into
worsening renal failure, and started on hemodialysis. Her course
was also complicated by upper GI bleed, of which an EGD showed
multiple AVMs. She required total of 5 units of PRBCs and by
discharge, HCT was stable at 26. She received her last
transfusion yesterday at HD.
Pt was discharged to rehab. She ate well for dinner under 2 gm
of sodium diet. She report feeling warm the evening prior to
admission but was afebrile. She still felt warm and diaphoretic
this morning. Again, she was afebrile per her husband. She did
have increased productive cough with mostly clear, occasionally
blood-tinged phlegm. She then became acutely short of breath
while lying down. She denied any CP, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting. She asked to return to the hospital.
.
In the ED, her initial VS were: T98, BP 150/80, HR 130, RR 42,
O2 sat 92% on ?RA. BiPap was started and her BP fell to 72/38,
and Bipap was switched to NRB. She was started on neo gtt and BP
came up to 130s/60s. BiPap was restarted with O2 sat of 100%. A
CVL was placed int he R groin. She also received ceftazidime and
vanc. She was transferred on NRB off neo.
.
On review of symptoms, her husband denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery. She continues to complain of
leg pain for which she was taking neurotin and vicodin.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope, or presyncope. She does have dyspnea on
exertion, orthopnea at baseline. She has never had ankle edema
in the past.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p cypher DES to LCX [**2174-5-13**], severe
aortic stenosis with valvular area of 0.5 cm2 despite recent
aortic valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-11**], frequent hospitalizations for
CHF exacerbation (last d/c [**2174-8-5**]), upper GI bleed from AVMs,
and ESRD recently restarted on HD who returned w/SOB, dialyzed,
and discharged back to extended care facility.
.
# CHF Exacerbation:  Patient initially presented with volume
overload on CXR and acute shortness of breath, was placed on
facemask, then later weaned to nasal cannula.  The patient was
emergently dialyzed, and subsequently her shortness of breath
resolved.  The patient was continued on low O2 nasal cannula,
followed via serial CXR's, and was given her outpatient dose of
carvedilol.
.
# Coronary artery disease: DES to LCx in [**2174-5-11**], other
coronaries w/o obstructive disease. Patient had CP the night
before admission and ECG showed J Point elevation.  Patient was
given O2 and cardiac enzymes were sent.  Patient was chest pain
free subsequently, EKG's were done which showed some minor
elevations, but none concerning enough in lieu of her existing
LBBB.  Patient was continued on her beta blocker, CE's were
followed and remained within the range of 0.11 which is her
chronic level and not concerning given the lack of an acute
rise, and her existing chronic kidney disease.  Plavix and ASA
were held given her recent upper GI bleed.
.
# Aortic Stenosis:  Worsened after valvuloplasty in [**4-21**]. Last
TTE [**7-27**] w/aortic valvular area of 0.5 cm2.  No realistic
percutaneous option as patient has 4 exclusion criteria for most
feasible trial.
.
# Anxiety:  Patient has had considerable anxiety on this
admission and during her stay at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  The patient was
amenable to and was given a prescription for citalopram.
.
# ID:  Pt presented with leukocytosis, though it later resolved
along with the rest of her CBC values, suggesting an inaccurate
measurement.  Pt had been afebrile and most recent WBC has
decreased to WNL.  U/A was positive but contaminated and pt had
long history of positive U/As with negative UCx, recently
completed 5 day course of cipro.  Pt recently ended course of
Vancomycin for strep veridins bacteremia. Blood and Urine
cultures were negative throughout admission, TTE negative for
any endocarditis.
.
# Upper GI Bleed: Hct suspiciously high.  No sig. bleeding.
Continued protonix [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Acute on chronic RF on Dialysis: Pt was given emergent
dialysis the day of admission, was also given EPO that she was
scheduled to receive.  Her shortness of breath resolved with
subsequent scheduled dialyses.
.
# Neovascular glaucoma:  Patient developed severe eye pain on
[**8-10**] while at dialysis.  On physical exam, patient's right eye
was injected, her pupil was dilated and non-reactive, and she
experienced pain in right eye when shining pen light into left
eye.  Ophthalmology was consulted, and she was found to have
neovascular glaucoma, an uncommon complication of retinal artery
occlusion.  Patient was started on Timolol, Alphagon,
Prednisolone, and latanoprost eye drops in right eye, twice
daily.  She was then seen in the [**Hospital 464**] clinic where she
underwent Pan-retinal phototherapy, vitrial tap and avastin
injection, OD.   Her eye drops were changed to a new medical
regiment including iopidine, azopt, alphagan, prednisolone,
atropine and erythromycin.  The patient was scheduled for a
follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Tuesday, [**8-16**].

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you became acutely
short of breath.  It was later believed that this episode was
similar to other episodes of shortness of breath that you have
experienced.  Those experiences were due to your heart being
unable to beat strongly enough through your narrowed valve and
your body having an excess of fluid, which backed up into your
lungs.  As a result, you required dialysis, which removed much
of the fluid in your lungs.  In your previous admission, you
were set up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Additionally, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will be able to make rounds at the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab facility

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2141-8-16**] for a "Whipple Procedure".

Pain: She had an epidural for pain control. She had an excellent
pain level and the epidural remained in place for 4 days. She
was then switched to a PCA and eventually switched to PO
Percocet with good pain control.

GI: She was NPO with a NGT and IV fluids. The NGT was removed
POD 3 and she was started on sips POD 4. Her diet was advanced
slowly as she had return of bowel function. She was noted to
have some loose bowel movements x 3 on POD 5. These resolved in
a day. On POD 6, a JP amylase was 44 and her drain was D/C'd POD
7. The staples were D/C'd on POD 8. There were no sign of
redness or infection.

Renal: She had low urine output post-operatively and she
received a 500 cc bolus of LR. A U/S of her kidneys was
unremarkable and showed no hydronephrosis. She did not respond
to the bolus and continued to be oliguric. She was transferred
to the SICU for further monitoring. POD 2, her urine output
began to improve and her creatinine remained low.

Heme/ID: She was noted to have a temperature of 101.1 on POD 2.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative. Her temperature
improved with hydration.

Neuro: The patient fell while getting out of bed. She felt
"dizzy" upon waking. She is alert and oriented to person, place,
month, President, and not year. She had no signs of head trauma,
or fractures.

Physical Therapy: She was seen several times and cleared by PT
to go home.

Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L thoracotomy with pericardial window and chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
72 W from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 466**] [**Country 467**], with multiple cancers including ovarian
(s/p s/p TAH SBO and 6 cycles of ctaxol/carboplatinium) and
cholangiocarcinoma (s/p whipple) with mets of uncertain origin
to liver and lung, recently admitted [**4-6**]-22 for CAP
(treated with azithro), originally admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for SOB,
orthopnea, and coughing which was initially attributed to CHF,
symptomatic hyponatremia (increasing confusion, lethary), and
ARF.  Cards was consulted and an echocardiogram revealed a
pericardial fluid collection with tamponade.  She was sent
urgently to the OR for a pericardial window via L thoracotomy.
She was out of the OR by [**8-28**] PM, extubated by 0400 the day of
transfer, and seemed to be doing well.  She was sitting up in a
chair when she was noticed to be unresponsive, but still
breathing and with a pulse.  She was transferred back to her bed
and at that ppint was noticed to be in full cardiac and
respiratory arrest without pulse or spontaneous respirations.
Patient did have a rhythm on monitor so patient was diagnosed
with PEA arrest.  CPR was initiated, she received 2 amps of epi
and an an of calium, she was intubated, started on Neo, and had
a femoral line placed.  Within 15 minutes pulse returned.  A
stat repeat ECHO was performed at that time and patient was
found to have [**Male First Name (un) **] (systolic anterior motion), severe MR, and new
wall motion abnormalities but no re-accumulation of pericardial
effusion.  She is now being transferred to the MICU for further
work-up and management.

IMAGING:
CT SCAN [**9-7**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Dependent atelectases are
present within
the lung bases bilaterally. There is no pleural effusion.
Visualized heart
and pericardium are unremarkable.

There is a striated appearance of bilateral kidneys, with
peripheral wedge- shaped hypodensities bilaterally. The largest
of these hypodensities is in the upper pole of the left kidney.
There is associated marked inflammatory stranding surrounding
both kidneys. Additionally, contrast is seen to excrete normally
from both kidneys. However, there is circumferential wall
thickening involving both ureters throughout its course. These
findings are overall suggestive of bilateral pyelonephritis,
with associated ureteritis. Although no discrete abscess is
identified, the hypodensity in the upper pole of the left
kidney, is likely at risk for developing an internal abscess.

The liver and gallbladder are within normal limits, with a focal
hypodensity adjacent to the gallbladder, may reflect an area of
focal fat. Spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are
unremarkable.

The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are unremarkable. The
appendix is not definitively visualized, without secondary
findings to suggest acute appendicitis.

There is no free fluid or free air. Scattered retroperitoneal
nodes are seen, not meeting CT size criteria for pathologic
enlargement.

Urinary bladder, rectum are unremarkable. There is no pelvic
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
IMPRESSION:
Findings most compatible with bilateral pyelonephritis and
ureteritis.
Although no discrete abscess is identified, a hypodensity within
the left
upper pole is seen, which may be at risk for developing into an
abscess. Close interval followup is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo female with hx of chronic hepatitis C infection (without
cirrhosis) presenting to the ED with 4 day hx of dysuria, chills
and found to have a grossly positive U/A with evidence of
bilateral pyelonephritis on CT Abd/pelvis who became hypotensive
to 80/30.
.
# Pyelonephritis/Sepsis: Pt w/ signs and sx of UTI for several
days; most likely with ascending GU infection. The patient has
no recent UTIs or hx of resistent organisms. The patient
presented to the ICU in stable condition.  CT scan of was
performed and consistent with pyelonephritis w/ no discrete
abscess, but showed a hypodensity that could represent possible
developing abscess in the left upper pole. She receieved cipro
in the ED prior to coming to the ICU and prior to blood
cultures.  The patient's blood pressures continued to range SBP
70-90's, but the patient had good mentation, urine output,
peripheral perfusion, and no compliants indication adequate end
organ perfusion.  Pt remains hypotensive (SBP 80-90) even after
receiving 7L of IVFs, but likely was dehydrated prior to
presentation and has high insensible losses due to fever.  Pt
also reports a "low" blood pressure at baseline. The patient was
also given one dose of stress dose steriods, but was
discontinued in the AM after her random cortisol was 32.  The
patient was continued on IV ciprofloxacin and and was
transitioned to po cipro 500mg Q12 x 14 day course.  The
patient's urine grew E. Coli and sensitivities were pending.
The patient's blood pressure ranged between SBP 90-110 on
discharge.  Pt was afebrile, ambulating, eating po, and feeling
back to her baseline.
.
# Acute renal failure: The patient initial creatine was 1.1 and
stablized to 1.0 today.  Her baseline is around 0.7. This is
likely prerenal w/ combination of poor po intake, vomiting,
fever.

your kidney.  You had a CT scan performed of your kidney and it
was consistent with a kidney infection.  You stayed in the ICU
because your blood pressure was low.  You were given fluids and
treated with antibiotics for your infection.  You improved with
these treatments and were able to go home on oral antibiotics.

Please follow the medications prescibed below.

Please follow up with the appoints made below.

Please call your PCP or go to the ED if you experience worsening
fevers, chills, pain with urination, nausea, vomiting, chest
pain, shortness of breath, back pain, or other worsening
symptoms.

***********
PCP:
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient should have a CBC and BP check tomorrow.  The
patient was hypotensive in ICU (not pressor dependent), but was
back to her baseline blood pressure at discharge and afebrile.
The patient's urine culture is growing E. Coli, but
sensitivities are not back.  Please call the ICU ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 506**])
to follow-up on sensitivies.  Additionally, the patient's CT
scan showed a hypodensity within the left upper pole, which may
be at risk for developing into an abscess. Close interval
followup is suggested. Imaging should be repeated if symptoms
worsen or recurrs after treatment.  The patient should be
continued for a 14 day course of antibiotics.

Service:  GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  On [**2112-6-5**] the patient had a
sudden onset of emesis in the morning with no associated
nausea, abdominal pain or change in bowel habits and is
passing flatus.  She also passed brown stool that day.  She
has had no signs of fevers or chills, or sick contacts or
recent travel.  Twenty years ago the patient had a similar
episode and by history she was told she had a gallbladder
problem, but she never had any treatment given.  She
presented to the Emergency Department with a fever of 104.4
and mildly tender right upper quadrant with negative [**Doctor Last Name 515**]
sign.  An ultrasound demonstrated multiple gallbladder stones
and a 1.4 cm stone in a 1.5 cm common bile duct.  No
intrahepatic ductal dilatation or gallbladder wall thickening
or pericholecystic fluid.  The patient received Levofloxacin
and Flagyl and was urgently seen by the ERCP fellow and taken
for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which
demonstrated some gastritis and severely deformed major
papilla and 8 mm common bile duct with no stones and a
sphincterotomy was performed with drainage of clear bile.
The patient was then admitted to the Medical Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.  Breast cancer
status post lumpectomy in [**2103**].  3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.  5.  Hypothyroidism status post
thyroidectomy.  6.  Left cataract surgery, corneal
transplant.  7.  Pernicious anemia.  8.  Stress incontinence.
9.  Appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Bactrim.

MEDICATIONS:  1.  Atenolol 50 mg po q day.  2.  Glyburide.
3.  Mavic one time per day.  4.  Synthroid 150 mg po q day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg po q day.  6.  Aspirin 81 mg po q day.  7.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The is a Russian immigrant who taught
English.  The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of
100.6, heart rate of 62, blood pressure 153/60, respiratory
rate 22, saturation 92% on room air.  Pertinent physical
examination demonstrated a soft, mildly tender right upper
quadrant with no [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  Normal rectal tone and guaiac
negative.

PERTINENT LABORATORY INFORMATION:  White blood cell count
4.4, PT 13.7, INR 1.3, total bilirubin was 0.4, ALT 34, AST
24, alkaline phosphatase 106.  Urinalysis negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was managed medically until the
[**4-10**], because the patient was refusing
cholecystectomy as was recommended.  However, on the [**4-10**] the patient was amenable to surgery, because of
persistent right upper quadrant soreness.  On [**6-10**] the
patient underwent an open cholecystectomy with a common bile
duct exploration and placement of T tube and intraoperative
cholangiogram.  The patient had some difficulty with
extubation, because of sedation and was transferred from the
[**Hospital Ward Name 516**] at [**Hospital1 69**] to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 517**] in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The
following day on postoperative day one the patient was
extubated after being weaned off her Propofol without any
complications and was maintained NPO.  The patient remained
well throughout the afternoon in the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit and was transferred to the floor.

On the floor the patient did well.  Physical therapy consult
was acquired where she performed well, but was recommended
for rehabilitation.  She began tolerating clears and a
regular diet.  She remained afebrile and she had her Foley
discontinued.  The patient had her JP tube discontinued and
was appropriate for rehab by postoperative day four [**2112-6-14**].

The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**] in two
weeks and during the same visit had a T tube cholangiogram
performed prior to seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**].  The patient will also go
to rehab for further physical therapy rehabilitation and
medical care.

Service:  GREEN GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 81-year-old elderly lady
underwent an open cholecystectomy and common bile duct
exploration for type I Mirizzi syndrome three weeks prior to
admission.  On [**2112-7-1**], one day prior to admission,
she had a normal T-tube cholangiogram without antibiotic
coverage.  She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] in his office and
approximately two hours later removed the T-tube without
incident.  After the removal of the tube, the patient
developed progressive nausea and chills and right sided
abdominal pain as reported by her daughter.  She presented to
the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Department
hypotensive to 80s systolic and acidotic leading to
intubation and institution of pressor support.  Her white
count at the time of admission was 12 with a total bilirubin
of 3.6.  AST and ALT were both above 500 with an alkaline
phosphatase of 334.  Her amylase and lipase were both in the
normal range.

On examination at the time of admission, Mrs. [**Known firstname 524**]
[**Name (STitle) 525**] abdomen was soft with mild right upper quadrant
guarding.  CT examination showed no collection and a mildly
dilated common bile duct.  Ascending cholangitis secondary to
seeding at the time of cholangiogram with stricture at the
T-tube site with or without a retained stone was the
diagnosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Breast cancer
3.  High cholesterol
4.  Diabetes mellitus
5.  Hypothyroidism
6.  Multinodular goiter

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Breast lumpectomy in [**2103**] and a
thyroidectomy in [**2106**].

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol
2.  Glyburide
3.  Synthroid
4.  Lipitor
5.  ASA

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2112-7-3**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 526**] was
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close
management of her respiratory, cardiovascular and infectious
status.  She was seen by the ERCP service/fellow and she
received an emergency MRCP for ascending cholangitis.  This
study showed altered papilla anatomy, dilated common bile
duct and question of common hepatic duct stricture.  There
was no small leak at the site of the cystic duct/T-tube
track.  The ERCP resulted in 10 cc of purulent aspirate and a
10 French x 8 cm stent was placed.  After this procedure,
Mrs. [**Known lastname 526**] continued to be monitored closely in the
Intensive Care Unit where her cardiovascular status was
monitored using a Swan-Ganz catheter.

By hospital day #3, Mrs. [**Known lastname 526**] was showing clinical
improvement from her ascending cholangitis.  On this day, she
started to wean off the ventilator and her white count
declined to 5.7.  The rest of Mrs.[**Known lastname 527**] Surgical
Intensive Care Unit course was characterized by progressive
weaning from the ventilators and from dobutamine and other
medications used to support her cardiovascular status.
Intravenous antibiotics consisting of Flagyl, ceftriaxone and
ampicillin were continued.  The patient was extubated on [**7-7**] and on [**2112-7-9**] she was transferred to the
patient floor out of the Intensive Care Unit and placed on
Levaquin.  Her status continued to stabilize and improve on
the floor and her condition at the time of discharge was very
good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Very good

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Ascending cholangitis

Per consultation with the physical therapy service, discharge
of the patient to a rehabilitation center was suggested, as
the patient lived alone and would not be able to, at the time
of discharge, successfully complete all of her necessary
activities of daily life.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] and this should be done in two
weeks after discharge.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is an 88 year old female, resident at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 553**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 554**] [**Hospital3 **], with medical history pertinent for
Parkinson's disease, Diabetes, and recent cornea transplant who
now presents with altered mental status.
Per last progress note from patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has been
in her usual state of health with exception of management of a
cervical vertebral fracture secondary to fall as well as plans
for a repat penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant) s/p
failed prior. The patient was at that time apparently at her
baseline and cleared for surgery. The patient underwent
penetrating keratoplasty on [**2119-3-30**] for indication of failed
graft without complication. The patient was seen by her
ophthalmologist on [**2119-4-4**] with impression that there was
moderate lid edema present suggestive of hypersensitivity but no
discharge to suggest infection. Polysporin was discontinued
(with concern for hypersensitivty per discussion with daughter)
and other meds (Pred 1% TID OS, Timolol 0.5% [**Hospital1 **] OU, Xalatan QHS
OS, Tobradex
[**Doctor Last Name **] OS QHS) continued.
The patient now presents form her [**Hospital3 **] with concern
for altered mental status. Only limited information is available
from available staff at [**Hospital3 400**], with report only that
patient was noted tonight to be acutely confused and "not making
sense". Per discussion with the patient's daughter, the patient
was in her usual state of health as early as yesterday morning,
looking well. Later in the day, the patient was reported to be
walking up and down the hallway, refusing to go to her room. The
patient was noted to be shivering and unsteady on her feet.
Recommendation was made that patient be sent to hospital for
further evaluation. Per discussion with daughter, the patient
has had prior episodes of confusion in setting of underlying
infetion, usually UTI.
.
ED Course: 98.4 -> 102.8 rectal, 186/84, 85, 20, 93% RA. Labs
notable for WBC 8.0, lactate 1.8. Not signed out, but per
nursing report and discussion a central line was attempted given
poor PIV access for which the patient received Haldol. No
documentation of dose is available, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN to RN signout this
was 5mg IV. Central line was not successfully placed and
ultimately a 22 PIV in the hand was obtained.
The patient had a negative UA, CXR without obvious infiltrate
although limited. Ophthalmology was not contact[**Name (NI) **] as [**Name (NI) **]
impression was that eye was not infected. LP was recommended by
ED but patients' daughter declined this. The patient was given
Azithromycin, Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone empirically and is now
admitted to the medical service for ongoing care.
On arrival to floor patient is lethargic but wakes to voice. She
answers questions although requires repeat questioning at times
to wake her. Patient reports mild neck pain since having collar
removed, denies headache, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain or
other localizing symptoms.

CT head [**4-5**]:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute fracture.
2. Diffuse cerebral atrophy with moderate sulcal and ventricular
prominence.
3. Chronic microvascular infarcts, unchanged.
4. Paranasal sinus disease as described, likely acute in the
sphenoid sinus.

CT neck [**4-6**]:
1. Significant swelling/inflammation of the soft tissues at the
base of tongue, oropharynx, with fullness in the vallecula and
the piriform sinuses, overall resulting in moderate to marked
narrowing of the oropharynx. The etiology of this finding is
uncertain from the present study. To correlate with direct ENT
examination.
2. Fullness of the hypopharynx and adjacent portions of
esophagus - no adequately assessed on the present study- further
evaluation recommended.
3. Increased attenuation of the fat in the carotid space, with
soft tissue attenuation opacity, with heterogeneous appearance,
causing indentation on the right internal jugular vein extending
down along the carotid space, into the region of the thoracic
inlet. This may relate to inflammation, phlegmon, and
radiation-related changes if there is history of radiation in
the past and less likely neoplastic. Close followup evaluation,
with ultrasound can be considered to evaluate for any abscess,
given the patient's symptoms of fever.

CT orbits:
1. Increased attenuation of the preseptal soft tissues with some
enhancement, on the left side, likely due to inflamamtion/
post-surgical changes- correlate with clinical examination. No
definite abscess on the present set of images. No intraconal
abnormality. F/u as clinically indicated.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus disease

CT head [**4-9**]:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Persistent cerebral atrophy.
3. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
4. Paranasal sinus disease.

MRI/MRA brain:
Final Report
HISTORY: Parkinson's, delirium, lethargy, right facial droop and
dysarthria.
Evaluate for signs of intracranial hemorrhage or acute stroke.

Comparison is made to most recent head CT of [**2119-4-9**]

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were
obtained through
the brain without intravenous gadolinium. 3D time-of-flight MR
arteriography
was also performed. Volume-rendering reconstructed images were
evaluated.

MRI OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of
intracranial
hemorrhage, masses, mass effect, or regions of restricted
diffusion to suggest
acute infarction. A few scattered periventricular T2/FLAIR
hyperintensities
are noted, which are nonspecific but likely suggest chronic
small vessel
ischemia. There are also adjacent prominent Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **]
spaces. While
there is underlying global cerebral atrophy, the degree of
dilatation of the
ventricular system may be somewhat disproportionate to the
amount of central
atrophy. Small amount of fluid is noted in the mastoids
bilateral.

MR arteriography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] displays no aneurysmal
dilatation.
Mild atherosclerosis is noted in the right M1 segment. Posterior
circulation
is left dominant.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarction. Scattered changes likely
related to
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

2. Question slightly disproportionate degree of ventricular
dilatation in
relation to the amount underlying cerebral atrophy. While this
finding is
nonspecific, in the appropriate clinical scenario it may reflect
underlying
NPH.



Brief Hospital Course:
This pt is a 88yo female w h/o Parkinson's disease, mild
dementia and recent corneal transplant admitted to the hospital
for AMS and to the ICU for airway narrowing.
.
# Airway narrowing: She was noted to have swelling of the tongue
and lower lips on admission. A CT of the Head and Neck with IV
contrast showed no clear evidence of preseptal cellulitis and ?
of soft tissue infection/edema of neck and throat. Over course
of day, noted to have increased audible upper airway sounds with
good O2 sat of 97% on 2L which has been stable. ENT was
consulted and saw extensive edema and soft tissue swelling in
oropharynx with patent airway. Swelling around false cords,
tonsillar edema, but true cords without edema. The team thought
the swelling to be secondary to possible allergic reaction to
medications. She was started on solumedrol 60IV and famotidine
20mg. She was given one dose of zosyn and then switched to
unasyn to cover for possible soft tissue infection. Pt without
leukocytosis, fever (was 102.8 in the ED but afebrile since), or
abcess. ENT and anesthesia recommended transfer to ICU for
further monitoring. She was monitored and continued on Decadron
for three doses. During successive scopes by ENT, oropharyngeal
edema and some secretions were seen, but airway remained patent.
Unclear etiology: possible allergic reaction vs infectious
process vs both given tonsils appear possibly infectious and
lower airway appears more edematous and less infectious.
Lisinopril was stopped, and her laryngoscopic exam visibly
improved by the time she was called out to the floor.
-Pt was treated for 10 days for ?soft tissue infection and
switched to Augmentin for additional 5 days at dc
-ENT follow up appt was set up

# s/p corneal TP: lid edema on exam. Ophtho believes likely
secondary to blockage of drainage and not as likely due to
allergy.  Ophtho felt the eye was improving and recommended
decreasing doses of eye drops.
-FU appt with Optho set up
.
#. Altered Mental Status: On admission, she was lethargic,
possibly from the Haldol she received in the ED. By the time she
was called out of the ICU, she was likely at her baseline mental
status, pleasant and easily conversant. Shortely thereafter,
however, she became agitated and combative and received 1.5mg
Haldol and later the same day 5mg of Zyprexa. She remained
agitated for about 36 hours before she became lethargic and
barely arousable. Head CT was unchanged from before. She had not
had any new fevers or new signs of infection. She had a lumbar
puncture that was unremarkable. MRI/MRA was neg except for some
ventriculomegaly in setting of global atrophy which was
difficult to differentiate from NPH. Neurology thought it was
unlikely to be NPH. EEG showed some focal acitivity concerning
for sublinical seizures. Pt was started on keppra, initially
continued to have periods of somnolence along with R sided
facial droop (which was thought be Neurology to represent a
post-ictal state with [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis) but day before discharge
had significant improvement in mental status and was alert and
conversive. Due to hx of dementia and also ongoing hypoactive
delirium, pt was not fully oriented but did have significant
improvement in level of alertness.
-Pt curently is on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week and to be
increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] later and kept at that dose.
-Pt should be followed by a neurologist at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
-Outpt FU w neurology is already set up
.

#. UTI: grew Enterococcus in UCx. She was continued on Unasyn
for 10 days.
.
#. Positive blood cultures: 1/4 bottles growing coag negative
Staph. This was likely a contaminant so vancomycin was stopped.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.

#. Parkinson's Disease: continued Sinemet except when patient
was too lethargic to safely take meds
.
#. Hypertension, benign: Lisinopril was stopped due to concern
of angioedema. Atenolol was continued.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: continued statin
.
#. Hypothyroidism:  TSH normal on [**2119-4-6**] so not a picture of
myxedema and cannot account for MS change. Continued
levothyroxine.

#. Diabetes II, diet controlled without complication:
- insulin sliding scale while inpatient  and bs were wnl. Pt can
have [**Hospital1 **] finger checks to Rehab but since not needing insulin,
does not have to be on sliding scale

# Deconditioning: per PT eval, pt was 2 person assist and will
need significant PT therapy to get back to baseline where she
was walking with a walker

Service:  GU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted on [**2141-7-4**], for a left nephrectomy and periaortic lymph node
dissection and cystoscopy secondary to diagnosis of
transitional carcinoma and a left renal mass. She was first
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2141-5-12**], for an evaluation of an
episode of gross hematuria that was associated with an
enhancing soft tissue mass in the upper pole of the
infundibulum of the left kidney. This was diagnosed by CT on
[**2141-5-9**]. Now was confirmed by MRI and measured to be
3.3 cm. The patient was then scheduled for a left nephrectomy
and staging studies revealed that the right kidney was OK.
She has no history of UTIs, colon cancer, smoking or dysuria.
However, there is a positive family history for renal cell
cancer in her brother who is currently affected.

ALLERGIES:  She reports no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications include Lipitor,
Norvasc, vitamins and aspirin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for questionable TIA which
gave her temporary memory loss. Her past medical history is
negative for a MI, angina, diabetes, colitis, COPD or any
thyroid disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Repair of a tendon in her right hand
in the remote past.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco and no drug use, but alcohol use
about 4 times a week.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother with renal cell
carcinoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Afebrile, vital signs
stable. General: She appears well and sitting comfortably.
HEENT: No masses. Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV: Normal sinus rhythm. Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the SICU on [**2141-7-4**], after her left nephrectomy, periaortic lymph node
dissection and cystoscopy. She did well postoperatively,
underwent no events in the SICU and was transferred to the
regular floor the following day on [**2141-7-5**]. She did well
on the floor. Her pain was well controlled and she was also
given Ancef for 3 doses. Chest x-ray in the SICU showed a 5
mm pneumothorax but the chest tube was pulled. The repeat
chest x-ray performed upon arrival to the floor was negative
for a pneumothorax. On [**2141-7-6**], postoperative day 2, the
patient continued to improve. She began to ambulate. Her NG
tube was discontinued. She was taken off telemetry. Yet, she
passed no gas, there was no flatus. Postoperative day 3, she
continued to improve and she continued to ambulate and still
awaiting return of bowel function. Postoperative day 4, her
abdomen was distended, slightly tympanitic. She was returned
to NPO, encouraged to ambulate, given PCA for her pain
control, and the results of her abdominal film were pending.
Her abdominal film came back negative. On [**7-9**],
postoperative day 5, she continued to do well and her diet
was advanced as tolerated after she passed gas and ambulation
was encouraged. Postoperative day 6, [**2141-7-10**], the
patient did very well in her whole hospital course, was doing
well in the morning and was discharged that evening. She was
given instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as well as
appropriate pain medication and Colace.

.
EGD ([**6-12**]): Esophagus: Granular, sclerosed appearing mucosa was
noted in the distal esophgaus with scant red blood. No bleeding
lesion was seen.
Stomach:  Clotted blood was seen in the stomach the full stomach
body could not be assessed due to resdual material. The

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57M PMH HIV, h/o lymphoma in remission, GERD with grade III
esophagitis p/w acute UGIB and hypotension, admitted to the
MICU.
.
# UGIB: Initially hypotensive with SBP 60's as per HPI.
Received blood and fluid resuscitation (7 units PRBCs total this
admission; 2 were emergency crossmatch). Admitted to MICU.  EGD
[**6-12**] with the above results.  On [**6-13**] patient had reported
hematocrit drop from 27 to 18; received 2 units and subsequent
hematocrits >30 and stable (?erroneous value).  EGD was done
again in light of hematocrit drop, again showing esophagitis but
no other lesions. Last transfusion on [**2102-6-13**].  GI and surgery
followed patient during admission.  Source of bleed appeared to
be esophagitis, as no other upper lesions noted.  PPI was
continued with [**Hospital1 **] dosing and sucralfate started.  Patient was
also asked to avoid chloral hydrate (had been taking at home for
sleep), which can cause gastritis.
.
# Coag negative staph bacteremia. [**4-11**] cultures were positive
from [**6-12**], initially thought to perhaps be a contaminant but
further bottles then became positive. Started vanco on [**6-13**].
Patient with recent root canal and given amox; ?source.  TTE was
done without evidence of vegetation.  Given low suspicion of
endocarditis, TEE was not done.  Surveillance cultures were all
negative.  Planned to treat patient with a 14 day course of IV
vancomycin; midline placed.  However, prior to arrangements
being made for home IV antibiotics, then patient insisted on
leaving AMA.  Midline pulled and patient placed on suboptimal
regimen of levofloxacin PO x 14 days.  He was informed that his
treatment regimen was not ideal and could lead to persistent
bacteremia and associated poor outcomes, but refused to stay
until arrangements could be made (if they could be at all given
his insurance).
.
# Fungemia.  On [**2102-6-15**] PM, [**2-10**] blood cultures from [**2102-6-12**] turned
positive for budding yeast.  He was given a dose of caspofungin.
 Possible portal of entry from subclinical esophagitis and entry
to bloodstream during GI bleed.  The seriousness of fungemia was
discussed with him, as well as needs to continue IV antifungal
treatments.  As above, he insisted on leaving on [**2102-6-16**], against
medical advice.  He appeared to have good understanding of his
disease and its risks (patient also a former nurse) but felt
that further workup was unnecessary and he had had his mind set
on leaving that day.   Efforts to look for source sites were
attempted; he had CT torso (no evidence of source for his
fungemia).  Ophthalmology was also consulted for dilated eye
exam, to which he initially agreed but then refused once they
arrived.  He also refused to stay in house for ID consult.  As
above, with him leaving AMA and no home IV treatment possible,
he was discharged home on a planned 2 week course of
fluconazole.  Following discharge, blood cultures were followed
and the yeast was determined to be [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] (high
resistance rates to fluconazole).  Both patient and PCP made
aware of this on [**2102-6-19**].  Per PCP and patient, planning for
very close followup over the next several weeks to include blood
cultures, daily temperature checks, etc.  Patient refused return
to the hospital for IV treatment and further workup.  Of note, 8
further bottles of blood cultures were negative (now final).
.
# Hypotension: SBP 60s on arrival; primarily hypovolemic with
?septic component as above.  Followup callout to the floor, his
SBP was in the low 90s but he was asymptomatic, not tachycardic.
SBPs recorded from outpatient notes generally ~110, but patient
reports BPs in 90's usually. Random cortisol in unit was 28.4.
.
# Leukocytosis: initially thought to be a stress response. Then
with 3/4 cultures positive for staph as above, also yeast as
above. CXR without infiltrate and UA negative.
.
# Delirium: Noted in the MICU in the setting of massive GIB and
bacteremia. The patient's baseline mental status per partner is
oriented x 3 but occasionally confused. Nonfocal neurologic
examination and once on medical floor he was back to baseline
per partner. [**Name (NI) **] last onc outpatient notes - increasing fatigue
and slurred speech.  Valium was held.
.
# Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal. Baseline creatinine
1.0-1.1.  Resolved.
.
# HIV: CD4 288, VL < 50 [**2102-5-15**]. Continued Atripla.
.
# Thrombocytopenia. Likely consumptive/dilutional given bleed
and resuscitation. Improved.
.
# Chronic pain: Chronic BLE pain thought due to zoster/MVA.
Continued lidocaine patch and amitriptyline.
.
# Depression: No active issues.  Continued effexor.
.
# Hypothyroidism: No active issues.  Continued levothyroxine.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: No active issues.  Continued lipitor.
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient and HCP

Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP


History of Present Illness:
84M PMhx metastatic papillary thyroid CA (s/p resection,
radioactive iodine) c/b lung mets, found to have large cavitary
mass in RLL, recent admission with malignant effusion + for SCC
recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna.  Prior
hospitalization was also notable for PET scan that revealed
widely metastatic disease.

He presents today from rehab with acute respiratory distress.
Pt is [**Name (NI) 595**] speaking so history was obtained from family.  At
baseline he is on 2L o2, yesterday he was doing well, but last
night he woke up in respiratory distress.  The rehab reported
that he was sating at 80% on a non-rebreather mask.  EMS was
called and he was transferred the the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Prior to event,
pt denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting.  He has a
chronic cough secondary to his lung ca but the quality of the
cough did not change.  he is not experiencing any pain.

Of note, pt's recent PMH is notable for rapid progression of
metastatic lung SCC.  He started experiencing chronic cough and
hemoptysis in [**Month (only) 547**] and symptoms have progressed since.  In [**Month (only) 596**]
he was noted to have a large cavitary mass in RLL with satellite
nodules suggestive of primary lung Ca.

At the end of [**Month (only) **] he was admitted to osh with fever,
leukocytosis and cough and treated with ctx.  His  symptoms did
not improve.  At this time a CT showed cavitary lesion as above
and a new large r exudative pleural effusion.  Effusion
reaccumulated resulting in supplemental O2 requirement.  As such
a chest tube was placed and the cytology came back + for SCC.
He was started on vanc zosyn for obstructive pna and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Hospital course was notable for r/o PE,
attempted pleurx catheter placement on [**6-27**] that failed due to
loculated effusions not amenable to pleurx.  At this point a PET
scan was done that showed extensive metastatic dz.

In the ED, initial VS were: t 98.1 80 106/46 80s on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he
was started on bipap 60 15/5 and his sats improved to 96%.  He
was noted to have bilaterally crackles throughout lung fields,
and a power picc was in place in right ac fossa.

CXR is consistent with prior xrays from earlier this month, but
RLL effusion appears to have expanded.  Labs were notable for
wbc of 38k with 94% N,  hct was 25 and platelets 504.  He was
given vanc and cefepine and transferred to the unit.

On arrival to the MICU, pt is somnolent, on bipap and sating in
the low 90s.  he is with his family and easily arousable.  He is
answering questions appropriately.  His family was concerned
that he has been over sedated since he last left [**Hospital1 18**].  The
report that he has been sleeping all day and are concerned that
he is receiving too much narcotics.  Apparently he was recently
started on a fentanyl patch 50mcg at rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
84M history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer (s/p
resection, radioactive iodine) complicated by lung metastases,
found to have large cavitary mass in RLL with recent admission
for malignant effusion positive for small cell lung cancer
recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna that presents
with acute respiratory distress. His respiratory distress was
thought to be secondary to aforementioned metastatic disease. It
was discussed with family and patient that his disease was
terminal without many further options. He was stabilized on
biPAP. Goals of care discussion yielded to make the patient
comfort measures only. He expired at 11:55 AM on [**2118-7-11**] with

[**2101-8-15**] CT Abd/pelvis :
High grade small bowel obstruction with dilated proximal loops
and decompressed distal loops with a transition point likely at
the site of right femoral hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 349**] was evaluated by the Acute Care team in the
Emergency Room and based on her physical exam and abdominal CT
she was admitted to the ICU for IV hydration, gastric
decompression and monitoring of her renal failure with operative
repair once she is fluid resuscitated.  Her creatinine was 2.2
on admission then decreased to 1.7 after 24 hours.

On [**2101-8-16**] she was taken to the Operating Room and underwent an
exploratory laparotomy with appendectomy and repair of her right
femoral hernia.  She tolerated the procedure well and returned
to the PACU in stable condition.  She maintained stable
hemodynamics and her pain was minimal.  She was transferred to
the Surgical floor and continued to make slow progress.  Her
abdominal wound was healing well and she worked with Physical
Therapy to increase her mobility.

Her diet was slowly advanced but she had problems with emesis
and it took quite a bit of time for her bowel function to
resume. Erythromycin and Reglan were started as pro motility
agents but she developed diarrhea with these and they were
stopped. Stool for C. difficile was sent and came back negative.
At baseline she has a limited appetite and was started on
Marinol as an appetite stimulant with significant improvement in
her appetite.

Her abdominal staples were removed on [**8-29**]. She is being
recommended for rehab and is being discharged from the hospital
after an extended stay following her surgery.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2101-11-1**]
A line insertion [**2101-11-2**]
PICC line [**2101-11-2**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/hx of COPD on 2L at baseline for last day has had increase
O2 requirement. Per husband/rehab has increased O2 requirement
over the last day. Coughing decreased from COPD baseline. Yest
was hypoxic and NC uptitrated to 5L. This AM requiring NRB (sats
and circumstances unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] has been afebrile but has
had increasing LE edema.

Per husbands report, had not been on home O2 for COPD until
placed in rehab in [**Month (only) 205**]. Had been living at home and very
functional until recent admission in [**Month (only) 205**] for N/V/Abd
distension. Had a laparotomy and appendix taken and out R
femoral hernia repaired. D/ced to rehab and has been there
since. Husband reports that roughly a week ago she had a
worsening cough and he thought she had developed bronchitis.
From the rehab charts it appears she was put on a prednisone
taper and azithromycin. He reports she had been improving with
these treatments until the last 2 days, although his history of
her worsening is very unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] ED signout from talking to
the nursing home she was more hypoxic yesterday requiring 5L NC
and being placed on a NRB this AM. He reports she was
complaining of no other symptoms but is unclear if there was any
change in her mental status.

He reports that at home baseline before rehab she was able to
talk roughly 50yds before being limited by shortness of breath.
She did all the chores, cooking, and cleaning at the house per
his report and they went out together 3x/week. Since her
admission to the hospital and discharge to rehab, he reports she
had not done as well, but again his history is somewhat unclear.

ED Course, presented with Temp 98.4, HR 96, BP 118/54, RR 44,
Sats 100% on NRB. Altered here, A&O x 1, husband (also in 90s)
says she is fine at rehab baseline. Rales bilateral bases with
JVD at mandible. CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions with
infiltrated on RLQ and concern for aspiration. WBC elevated to
17.3 (89% PMNs without bands, Bcx drawn, and started on
vanco/zosyn. EKG: NSR at 94, NA/NI, No ST elevations. Given
combivent trial with 125mg IV methlyprednisone. Initial Chem 7
with HCO3 of 42, BNP of 1700. Initial VBG on NRB showed 7.23 /
112 / 55 / 49. Trialed on BiPAP with ABG showing 7.18 / 138 /
209 / 54. Pt wasn't tolerating BiPAP and kept taking off. Resp
rate high but other VSS. ED called PCP and daughter as pt had
DNR order but no DNI order and husband wanting everything done.
Daughter and PCP decided to intubate and see how things go with
thought that would withdraw care if dosen't recover. Easy
intubation. Intubated with succinylcholine and propofol. After
intubation and propofol BPs dropped to 80s/60s, given 1L NS and
switched to Midazolam and Fentanyl. Did not require pressors and
BPs came up to 110-120s. No CVL placed (2 PIV). Yellowish fluid
from lungs after intubation (unclear when was aspirating - with
intubation vs yest).

VS on ICU arrival now: Afebrile, BP 106/51, HR 81, RR 20, 98% on
100% FiO2 on Vent. Pt unable to respond to questioning and so no
ROS could be obtained.

IMAGING:
[**2101-11-1**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Small bilateral pleural effusions
with patchy
opacities in the lung bases, which are nonspecific, and may
reflect
aspiration, infection, or atelectasis.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
Evaluation of the study is limited due to technique, also the
patient's chin obscures the apices of the lungs. Allowing this
limitation, the ET tube is against the right tracheal wall. NG
tube is in the stomach. Cardiomegaly is stable. Bilateral
pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis have increased. The
upper lungs are hyperinflated.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
Comparison to prior chest radiograph for PICC line is now seen
up until the subclavian on the right vein on the right side is
not seen any further than that point. The rest of the chest
radiograph is unchanged from prior and extremely difficult to
interpret secondary to patient positioning.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-1**] and 28:
Right PIC line passes into the right neck, where the tip
position is unclear, but at least 4 cm above the thoracic inlet.

Nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach and out of view.
Heart size is top normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions have
improved since earlier in the day, but there is no suggestion of
new consolidation at the right lung base which could be
pneumonia and warrants careful followup.

[**2101-11-3**] CXR
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by kyphotic positioning of the
patient, resulting in obscuration of the lung apices and
superior mediastinum. Endotracheal tube remains in place with
tip at approximately the thoracic inlet level. Nasogastric tube
courses below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged in appearance. Persistent bibasilar opacities, likely
a combination of pleural effusions and provided history of
aspiration pneumonia. Tip of right PICC has been withdrawn and
now terminates in the right axilla.

[**2101-11-5**] CXR
AP chest radiograph:
The study is suboptimal given the rotated position of the
patient and his neck being in extreme flexion and the head
overlying the lung apices. Within those limitations, the ET tube
tip appears to be close to the carina, approximately 1 cm above
it and reposition might be considered.
The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely
terminating in the
stomach. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
is
redemonstrated.

[**2101-11-9**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], the
head of the patient greatly obscures the upper lungs.
Endotracheal tube is not definitely seen.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. Central catheter from the
right appears to extend to at least the lower portion of the
right atrium.

[**2101-11-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant
change. Technically problem[**Name (NI) 115**] examination. Evidence of
moderate
cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and small bilateral
pleural
effusions. Unchanged position of the right PICC line.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with severe underlying COPD admitted with hypercarbic
respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. Her
course was notable for MICU admission requiring intubation and
succesful extubation. Her floor course was c/b heart failure,
metabolic disarray, and persistent high oxygen requirement and
work of breathing. The patient elected to make her code status
DNR/DNI/No NIPPV and unfortunately her respiratory function
continued to deteriorate over her hospitalization and she
ultimately passed away.

#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/COPD/Pneumonia/Acute-on-chronic
diastolic heart failure/Hypernatremia:
Patient was admitted to the MICU after intubation in the ED for
hypercarbic respiratory failure that did not improve with NIPPV.
She was felt to have pneumonia on top of a severe COPD
exacerbation and was initially treated broadly with Vancomycin,
Levaquin, and Cefepime as well as steroids and bronchodilators.
Her antibiotics were narrowed to Levaquin and the patient was
able to be extubated. She was also diuresed with improvement in
her symptoms. She was extubated and transferred to the floor but
had persistent oxygen requirement requiring 50% O2 by face mask
to maintain oxygen saturation in the low 90s. She was noted to
be volume overloaded but diuresis was complicated by
hypernatremia requiring intermittent free water repletion and
hypokalemia with runs of NSVT on telemetry and paroxysms of
atrial tachycardia to the 150s. She was maintained on
levofloxacin and steroids, given morphine as needed for symptoms
of dyspnea, and diuresed but did not improve.  Over the last 3
days of her hospitalization she slowly declined with worsening
respiratory status, increased work of breathing, and more
frequent episodes of somnolence and confusion.

#Goals of care:
Given the severity of both acute and underlying illness,
Palliative care was consulted and the overall poor outlook was
discussed with the patient, her husband, and her children. The
patient expressed that she did not want CPR or intubation and
did not want non-invasive ventilation. On [**2101-11-10**] AM the patient
had significant respiratory distress marked by tachypnea,
altered mental status, and evidence of volume overload on exam.
She was diuresed and given more aggressive nebulizers and her
antibiotics were expanded, but she continued to decline and
ultimately passed away on the morning of [**2101-11-10**]. Her family and

History of Present Illness:
82 year old male with HTN, chronic CHF, and COPD BIBA after
developing SOB. Pt has noted increasing SOB on exertion over the
past week. Has also noted occasional episodes of diarrhea and
rare short bouts of chest pain. Increasing DOE on exertion
yesterday. Today walked to his car and was so short of breath he
leaned on the [**Doctor Last Name 534**] to attract attention for help. A neighbor
came and found him and called an ambulance.
.
Of note pt was also admitted [**2190-1-30**] for SOB, c/w CHF
exacerbation, responded to lasix.

findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o M history of HTN found with respiratory distress
requiring bipap, hypertension, and newly noted to be in new
atrial fibrillation.
.
#Respiratory distress/SOB: The patient's shortness of breath was
felt to be due to a combination of heart failure and COPD
exacerbation, discussed separately below. There was also concern
for possible pneumonia on initial CXR, but the patient remained
afebrile, and follow-up CXR showed no infiltrate. At the time of
discharge, the patient was able to maintain good oxygenation
saturations with ambulation on room air.
.
#Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented
with shortness of breath. Cardiac enzymes were negative. He was
initially treated with lasix, bipap, and nitro gtt, although he
did not appear grossly volume overloaded. As his respiratory
status improved, he was transitioned to oral furosemide. TTE
showed preserved systolic function, and was unchanged from prior
study.
.
#COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with shortness of
breath and diffuse wheezing in the setting of a smoking history.
He was noted to have symbicort on his medication list but was
not taking this currently. He was given azithromycin x 5 days,
nebulizers, and was started on a prednisone taper. The plan for
the remainder of the taper is as follows: 20 mg daily [**Date range (1) 604**],
10 mg daily [**Date range (1) 605**], 5 mg daily [**Date range (1) 606**]. Symbicort and
Spiriva were started. The patient was urged to stop smoking.
.
#Atrial fibrillation, with rapid ventricular response: The
patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation, which is a new
diagnosis for him. He had rapid ventricular response, treated
with metoprolol, with improvement in heart rate. Metoprolol was
uptitrated to 300 mg daily. The patient's CHADS score is 3.
Anticoagulation was recommended to the patient and his family,
and the patient elected to defer this decision for now and
discuss with his primary care doctor.
.
#Hypertension: The patient was noted to have BP of 200/100 by
EMS. It is unclear if his marked hypertension was a cause of his
shortness of breath (flash pulmonary edema), or a consequence of
his respiratory distress. The patient's blood pressure rapidly
improved. The patient's home amlodipine, hydralazine, and
isosorbide monotitrate were continued. Furosemide was initially
given IV, then convered back the patient's home dose. Metoprolol
was increased to metoprolol succinate 300 mg dialy in the
setting of Afib with rapid vemtricular response. Clonidine was
changed to twice daily dosing (0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **]).
.
#Elevated lactate: The patient had lactate 5.4 on presentation.
This rapidly downtrended to 1.6. There was no evidence of
hypoperfusion. The elevated lactate may have been related to
increased work of breathing in the setting of respiratory
distress, although the rapidity of the resolution (normalizing
in <2 hours) also raises the possibility that the initial
lactate was a spurious laboratory value.
.
#Eosinophilia: Patient with 7.8% eosinophils out of WBC 8.2. On
review of past laboratory date, it is apparent that this is a
chronic process.
.
#Chronic kidney disease, stage II: Creatinine was 1.3 on
admission, which is the patient's baseline. Creatinine increased
slightly to 1.6 with diuresis and subsequently remained stable
at 1.5-1.6.
.
#Transitional issue: The patient will complete his prednisone
taper and follow up in primary care and pulmonology for further
management of his dyspnea. Visiting nursing was arranged to
assist the patient with medications.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with difficulty breathing. You were
initially admitted to the intensive care unit. You were treated
with steroids and inhalers, with improvement in your breathing.
You were also treated with diuretics for heart failure.
.
You were found to have an irregular heart rhythm called atrial
fibrillation. You had some rapid heart rates. Due to this, your
metoprolol was increased, with some improvement in your heart
rate.
.
Atrial fibrillation places you at an increased risk for stroke.
You can decrease this risk by taking blood thinning medications.
We discussed the risks and benefits of blood thinning
medications, and you decided that you wanted to defer this
decision for now and speak with your primary care doctor.
.
We have arranged follow-up with your primary care doctor and
with a lung doctor (pulmonologist). See below for details.
.
You need to stop smoking. It is making your lung disease worse.
.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
.
There are some changes to your medications:
1. CHANGE clonidine to 0.1 mg twice daily.
2. START metoprolol succinate 300 mg daily. This is a more
long-acting form of metoprolol that you will take daily instead
of metoprolol tartrate (short-acting form). You will start
metoprolol succinate tomorrow morning [**2191-5-15**]. For tonight
[**2191-5-14**], you will take one metoprolol tartrate 100 mg pill
(given to you by the hospital to take home).
3. STOP ibuprofen as this can cause kidney problems in patients
with high blood pressure.
4. START Symbicort (budesonide-formoterol) inhaler.
5. START Spiriva (tiotropium) inhaler
6. START prednisone taper, as follows:
   20 mg (2 tablets) daily [**Date range (1) 604**]
   10 mg (1 tablet) daily [**Date range (1) 605**]
   5 mg (half tablet) daily [**Date range (1) 606**]

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred for seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation



History of Present Illness:
86y M with PMH significant for HTN, CAD s/p CABG, afib (now on
warfarin), stroke 2y ago, and a seizure disorder on Keppra
(previously seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 619**]. atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin. who presents with left ear pain. He
presented to the OSH ED ([**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**]) 1wk PTA with CC: ear pain.
He was sent home with Dx of cerumen in external canal. His ear
pain continued and this past Friday his PCP prescribed [**Name9 (PRE) 621**] gtt
for presumed otitis externa. Per his son, he developed
progressive confusion and imbalance. He became unable to walk,
and became more somnolent.

He returned to the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] in the evening of [**2158-2-13**]
(1d
prior to transfer here), where his VS were notable for fever to
102.2F (after arriving afebrile) and tachycardia (normalized
with
1.5 L IVF), and exam was notable for somnolence. His WBC was
elevated at 14.9. INR was 3.3. Dig 0.84. Troponin negative. UA
"negative" and CBC/BMP/LFTs reportedly unremarkable/wnl. A NCHCT
showed *Left mastoiditis*. He was given a dose of IV Zosyn. ENT
was consulted, and recommended admission for surgical Tx the
following morning and switching to CTX (2gm IV) for mastoiditis
Tx. He was given his evening dose of warfarin after clearance
from ENT, with a plan for ENT surgery and ID consultation in the
morning.

However, around 6:00am the morning after admission ([**2157-2-14**]), the
patient had a GTC seizure requiring 12mg IV lorazepam to stop.
He
was loaded with 1gm of IV phenytoin and his levetiracitam was
increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] (from his home dose of 750mg [**Hospital1 **]). He
was
intubated and maintained on a propofol gtt on and off. His
post-ictal exam was notable for spontaneous movements of all
four
extremities, but lack of eye opening/arousability. A Neurologist
there saw the patient, but his notes are not immediately
available to me. His HCT was repeated after the seizure, and a
very tiny focus of hemorrhage (hyperintensity) was seen at the
posterior end of the Left lateral ventricle (~trigone). There
was
also also a call of hyperintensity in the interpeduncular fossa
(which would, if true, suggest subarachnoid blood, but on
reviewing the images I think this is an overcall). Finally,
there
was a large hypodensity in the Right temporal lobe, which looks
old, and could be the "old stroke" seen on MRI in [**2156**] on OSH
workup in [**State 622**] for his only previous GTC seizure (see PMH,
below).

The OSH physicians thought he may have hemorrhagic conversion of
an acute stroke in the Right temporal lobe (despite a lack of
any
evidence for this on the NCHCT), and held his warfarin, which
was
a good idea anyway because he had a supratherapeutic INR at the
time of 3.7. After discussing the case with a Neurologist here
at
[**Hospital1 18**], they decided to hold off on reversing his coagulopathy
with vitamin K or FFP. They continued his statin.

Regarding his infectious and other general medical
workup/treatment, he had [**4-17**] BCx bottles return positive for GPC
in pairs. The cultures were repeated post-antibiotics. A TTE was
obtained out of concern for septic cerebral embolus, and it did
not show valvular vegitations, but did show several
thickened/diseased valves. TEE was considered, but not done. He
was given a couple liters of IVF for decreased urine output (and
urine was dark on arrival here). He was continued on his digoxin
(level y/d was 0.86), and his home BB and CCB were held. He was
doing just find on MV/CMV with ABG of 7.39/35/174 and an
unremarkable CXR. They did not start tube feeds.


Past Medical History:
  1.  Hypertension, on CCB/BB
  2.  Hyperlipidemia, on statin
  3.  Atrial fibrillation, lonstanding, now on warfarin (started
[**2157-12-6**], see OMR Cardiology note)
  4.  h/o stroke seen on MRI at OSH (in [**State 622**], on
presentation
for stroke, see below) > or = 2y ago, details unknown to me at
this point other than an OSH MRI from [**2156**] showed an "old
stroke," which seems like the most likely culprit for his
subsequent memory deficits and the seizure in [**2-/2156**] (and now)
and the old Right-temporal abnormality seen on HCT at the OSH.
  5.  Seizure disorder -- first seen by a Neurologist in clinic
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 623**] here @[**Hospital1 18**] in early [**2156**], seen two
subsequent times through 9/[**2156**]. Initially presented to OSH in
[**State 622**] with first-ever seizure [**2156-3-1**] ([**Hospital 624**] hospital in
[**Location (un) 625**], VA; had been visiting his son) -- a GTC x 30-45min and
post-ictal [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 555**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 167**]-hemiparesis, which resolved; reportedly
negative MRI, echo, and EEG at the OSH, and a normal EEG here at
[**Hospital1 18**]. See OMR for details. Although he was on 750mg [**Hospital1 **] of
Keppra as of the last clinic note from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. in [**2156**], the
transfer admission from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] [**2-13**] today says that he was
only taking a very small dose of this AED at home, 250mg [**Hospital1 **].
  6.  "memory issues" since the stroke/seizure in [**2156**].
  7.  CAD s/p 3v CABG [**2143**]
  8.  h/o SBO after knee surgery, details unknown to me at this
point
  9.  h/o "knee surgeries" (R-knee replacement)
  10.  "hay fever", on daily diphenhydramine at home for qAM
rhinorrhea (per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**] [**2158-2-13**])
  11.  h/o Depression, details unknown at this time (of note,
wife died in [**2156**] after stroke, cancer).
  12.  h/o partial bowel resection (?no cancer found), temporary
colostomy, reconnected; details unknown to me at this time, now
c/b chronic diarrhea 2-3x per day.
  13.  h/o prostate cancer s/p XRT, details unknown to me at
this
time
  14.  unsteady gait, walked with cane at home

Pertinent Results:
Current Labs:

WBC 6.2 Hb 11.4 HCT 34.6 Plt 161
Na 139 K 4.8 Cl 109 CO2 22 BUN 23 Cr 0.6 Glu 108
INR 1.4

EEG ([**2-15**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence
of a
poorly maintained 6.5 Hz background which appeared only briefly
and due
to generalized delta slowing which predominated the record. This

represents a mild to moderate encephalopathy. It is also
abnormal due
to the presence of right temporal slowing and lower voltage
activitiy
which indicate focal subcortical dysfunction. Occasionally, left

fronto-temporal broad-based sharp waves were seen although they
were not
clear spikes, but may indicate a propensity to focal cortical
irritability. If the clinical suspicion for seizures is high,
prolonged
bedside EEG monitoring may helpful for further diagnosis

MR head: No acute infarction; Redemonstration of susceptibility
and fluid-fluid layering within the bilateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
consistent with a scant amount of intraventricular hemorrhage;
Opacification of the left mastoid which given the central
diffusion abnormality may represent acute mastoiditis as there
is no evidence that this is chronic, recommend clinical
correlation.

CT abd ([**2-20**]):  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with no
discrete transition point and an uncomplicated small
bowel-containing left inguinal hernia, most likely represent
ileus or enteritis

CT head ([**3-3**]): No acute abnormality is seen. Old right temporal
lobe infarction


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 627**] is an 86-year-old man with a complicated past
medical history that includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
coronary artery disease status post
CABG in [**2143**], atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with a prior
stroke and right temporoparietal encephalomalacia, history of
small-bowel obstruction with a partial colectomy, temporary
colostomy, and subsequent reanastomosis, who was initially
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 628**] for a complaint of jaw
pain and subsequent mastoiditis.  There, he was started on
antibiotics and ultimately sustained a prolonged seizure
requiring intubation.  He was then subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] and spent the first several
days of his admission in the trauma ICU.

Seizures: He has had known seizure disorder since [**2156**] and was
treated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 629**] on Keppra 750 [**Hospital1 **]. At the OSH he
had another GTC in the setting of lowering his AED to 250 [**Hospital1 **]
and a fever (unknown origin). He was at the time complaining of
ear pain, and ENT had planned a procedure at the outside
hospital, but he ended up seizing and requiring 12 mg Ativan
which necessitated intubation and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. He had been
loaded with Dilantin and Keppra was increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He
had a routine EEG performed on arrival that showed him to be
encephalopathic. At that point he was taken off of the dilantin
and continued on Keppra. He had MR imaging of his head to make
sure there was no new process contributing to his change in
status; MR imaging (including MRI/A/V) was normal. He remains on
Keppra and has been seizure free while on the floor.

Ear Pain: ENT was consulted regarding his MRI finding of
opacification in the left mastoid. He had Strep pneumoniae
otitis media and mastoiditis complicated by bacteremia. ENT felt
the opacification was a chronic inflammation and that no surgery
was indicated at this time.

Fevers: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 630**] had 2 culture bottles from OSH that grew
Streptococcus. He had no LP performed as it was felt that the
risk of reversing his anticoagulation was greater than the risk
of empirically treating him for a meningitis. ID consult was
obtained and they suggested a TEE which was performed that
showed no cardiac vegetations. He had urine cultures, blood
cultures, and sputum cultures that were all negative. A BAL
culture grew only Commensal Respiratory Flora. He was started on
Vancomycin, Cefepime and Flagyl for his strep bacteremia and
fevers and continued on this therapy until [**2-24**]. This was then
changed to Ceftriaxone 2gm Q24h for 4 more days to complete a 2
week course of abx for Strep pneumo bacteremia. He has currently
completed all of his antibiotics and has remained afebrile.

Ileus: During hosptialization, he developed loose stools and
abdominal distention. C. diff negative.  Seen by surgery
service. KUB and CT scan suggestive of an ileus.  No transition
point on CT scan to suggest SBO.  He had NG placed to wall
suction for decompression. This is now improved and his diet has
been advanced.

Atrial Fibrillation: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 630**] was on coumadin for his Afib. It
was held on day 1 of his hospitalization as it was
supratherapeutic at 3.3 and there was concern of a small area of
intraventricular hemorrhage. He was restarted on anticoagulation
with one day of heparin bridging when he was unable to take PO
medications.

HTN: Amlodipine changed to 10mg daily.

Wound Care: He was found to have sacral coccyx tissue breakdown
as was seen by wound care. Determined to be severe fungal rash
related fecal incontinence, no
pressure related breakdown. He has been on Miconazole powder.
New wound care recs will sent with discharge paperwork.

Ileus


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
  You presented to a hospital with a generalized tonic clonic
seziure in the setting of a lowered AED dose and a fever. You
received 12 mg Ativan to stop the seizure and required
intubation for airway protection; you were then transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further management. You were loaded with Dilantin
and your Keppra was increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Your current dose
of Keppra remains at 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]
  You were seen by ENT service regarding your opacification in
the left mastoid noted on MRI. They felt that this was chronic
inflammation and no current intervention was reccommended at
this time.
  For your fevers, cultures from the outside hospital grew
streptococcus. Antibiotics were started for strep bacteremia and
you completed a 2 week course. Repeat cultures here were
negative.
  During hospitalization, you were having abdominal pain and
distention; there was concern for a small bowel obstruction so
you were seen by the surgery service. No surgical intervention
was necessary, but you did receive a NG tube for decompression.
This was likely an ileus and did improve. You are now able to
tolerate an oral diet.




Followup Instructions:
Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 631**] within 3-4 weeks of
discharge

Please follow-up with your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1-2 weeks of discharge

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 634**] is a 47 year old af am female with past medical
history of thyroid cancer s/p
thyroidecomy and RAI 20 years ago who presented with bloody
emesis after nausea and vomiting and noted to have severe
thrombocytopenia to 5. Initially managed in ICU with IVIG and
PLT transfusion, then transferred to the floor where a diagnosis
of ITP was made.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Most likely due to immune thrombocytopenic
purpura.  Differential includeed aspartame induced
thrombocytopenia from her hawaiin cool aid, infections (HIV or
HepC) induced thromboyctopenia.  Peripheral smear without
shistocytes argued against TTP.  Normal coagulopathy. No new
medications to suspect cause of thrombocytopenia . In the ICU,
the patient was started on IV solumedrol 125 mg and gave 1 unit
of platelets.  PLT increased to 44 then trended back down, so pt
was started on IVIG.  No signs of active bleeding with stable
Hct. Pt was transitioned IV steroids to prednisone 100 mg po
qdaily (1mg/kg).   Checked HIV ab and HepC ab, HCV VL, HIV VL
(all negative).  After transfer from ICU, pt was continued on PO
Prednisone 1mg/kg, and PLTs trended up, and on discharge were
88.  On day of discharge Pt was at her home functional baseline,
tolerating a full diet, moving her bowels, and urinating.  There
were no s/s of bleeding. She was discharged on a regimen of 50mg
prednisone [**Hospital1 **] (pt preference to take [**Hospital1 **] rather than 100mg
daily).. Taper will be directed by hematology. She was
instructed to follow up for serial CBC monitoring. ITP could
have been promoted by H.pylori, see below.
++++ Pt should continue bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] as well as calcium
and vitamin D for bone health while on prednisone therapy.
.
# HEMATEMESIS/UGIB: Differential includes [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear
complicated by thrombocytopenia vs peptic ulcer disease vs
variceal bleeding vs gastitits vs dieulafoy's lesion, no history
of NSAID use. Initially managed in ICU. HCT and hemodynamically
stable during entire admission. Pt never experienced any
evidence of GIB during admission. HPylori test done and was
positive. Pt was started on triple therapy of Omeprazole PO,
Clarithromycin 500mg [**Hospital1 **], and Amoxicillin 1g [**Hospital1 **] x 14 days.  We
recommended the patient to follow up with GI for an EGD
.
#leukocytosis-likely a result of steroid use. No signs of
infection noticed during admission. Would monitor CBC after
discharge.
.
## TRANSITIONAL
- Discuss with your PCP about EGD to definitively evaluate for
cause of hematemesis and to evaluate for PUD.
- Discuss with Hematology regarding Prednisone taper/dosing
- Monitor your blood glucose since you are now on Prednisone.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 634**],

Thank you for choosing [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted for vomiting
blood in the setting of a very low platelet count due to ITP
("immune thrombocytopnia"). You were stabilized in the Intensive
Care Unit with platelet transfusion, Intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG), and steroids.  With these interventions your platelet
count increased so you are safe for discharge home with
Hematology follow-up.  Please have outpatient blood tests done
in 3 days (on Friday [**8-14**]) to check your platelets, which will
be followed up by Hematology.  You have been given a lab slip
for this.

The cause of your initial vomiting and blood are unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **]
might have had a viral illness causing wretching, resulting in a
small esophageal tear.  But it is also possible that you could
have peptic ulcers, which could be supported byt the fact that a
tests suggested that you have H.pylori, a bacteria which can
cause ulcers.  You should complete a 2 week course of
antibiotics/acid suppressors in order to eliminate this bacteria
(Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin, and Omeprazole).  In addition, you
should have an EGD (upper endoscopy), which has been scheduled
for you.

While on the antibiotics, you should be aware they can cause
side effects of easy sun burn, interactions with alcohol, and
birth defects. Please avoid the sun and use sunblock, minimize
or avoid alcohol consumption, and use two methods of
contraception.

MEDICATIONS
- Start Prednisone (this medication will be tapered down based
on your discussion at your upcoming Hematology appointment)
- Start Omeprazole, Amoxicillin, and Clarithromycin for 2 weeks

then called EMS.  He arrived at the [**Hospital6 649**] Emergency Department at approximately 11:30
p.m.  He was vomiting at that time but denied headache or
change in vision.  He was noted at that time to have slurred
speech, inability to stand and left-sided weakness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant gastrointestinal bleed.
Sleep apnea for which he is on CPAP.  Peptic ulcer disease.

bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2.  Regular rhythm.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft and nontender.
Extremities:  No edema.  Neurological:  He was awake, alert,
oriented to self, age, month, year, place.  He had severe
dysarthria but with normal naming, repetition and
comprehension.  He had marked neglect of the left
initially and only limited insight into his weakness.  Cranial
nerves: His pupils were equally
reactive from 4-2 mm bilaterally.  No relative ABT.
Extraocular movements full.  Visual fields were intact to
confrontation.  He had a severe left central facial droop.
Sensation was decreased in V1, V2, and V3.  His palate moved
symmetrically.  His shoulder shrug was 5 out of 5.  Tongue
was midline.  Motor:  Left arm was flat and 0 out of 5 motor
strength.  His left leg exhibited 2 out of 5 motor strength.
His right arm and leg were both 5 out of 5 strength.  He had
increased tone in the left upper extremity.  Sensory:  No

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs included a CBC with a white
count of 8.9, hematocrit 41, platelet count 240; INR 1.1, PTT
26.4; sodium 135, BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, glucose 113, CK
256, troponin less than 0.3, MB 3.

Labs from [**1-25**] showed [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] positive at 1-180 with a
speckled pattern; double-stranded DNA was pending; Rheumatory
factor was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neuromedicine Service.  The stroke attending was called and
was present within 15 min of the patient's arrival to the
Emergency Department.  TPA was prepared but not given, as the
patient seemed to have a hemorrhage while in MR scanning.
MRI was reviewed with the stroke attending and discussed with
the Neurosurgery resident on call.

Dr. ..................., his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
[**Name (NI) 653**], as well as the patient's son and his wife.

The MR [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) 655**] hemorrhage in the temporal lobe
on the right side with ventricular
extension into the right frontal lobe.  There was no evidence
of a mass or aneurysm on MRA.  The patient was admitted to
the Neuromedicine Intensive Care Unit for further management
at that time.

On [**2-13**], angiogram was performed which showed no
evidence of arterial venous malformation or fistula.  A
repeat CT showed increased signs of the area affected by the
hemorrhage which was likely due to redistribution of the
bleed, but there was no new blood seen on the scan.  The
bleed extended further into the right frontal cortex.  The
patient was started on Dilantin for prevention of seizures.

On [**2-14**], Speech and Swallow evaluation was performed,
and it was suggested that the patient have only honey-thick
liquids; however, he did not tolerate this well in the
Intensive Care Unit, as he was choking on these at the
bedside, and he was kept NPO from then on.

On [**2-15**], ................... returned showing
..................  ....................  At this point, it
was considered most likely that his bleed was secondary to
amyloid angiopathy.  Speech and Swallow evaluation was
repeated at the bedside on [**2125-2-16**], which showed
him to have decrease in his ability to swallow at this time.

The patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to
the floor of Far Five on [**2125-2-16**].  There was very
little change in his exam over the next two days; however, on
the 24th, it was noted that he had small contractions with
effort in his left hamstring and abductor, as well as
response to cold on that side.  He was also better able to
form sounds, "ga, ma and la" with less dysarthria.

Repeat swallow study was performed which showed remarkable
improvement with him having difficulty only with swallowing
pills.  He was therefore placed back on a soft diet with
clear liquids and crushed pills and apple sauce.

His left-sided neglect continually was improving with much
effort from both the patient and his wife, reminding him pay
more attention to his right side.

On [**2-20**], bilateral lower extremity Dopplers were
obtained and showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

=======================================

HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2132-4-11**]): POSITIVE BY
EIA.

=======================================

EGD ([**2132-4-9**])
Old blood and clots were seen throughout stomach. Copious
irrigation of clots was performed. There were multiple punctate
areas of red blood in the fundus. These were washed and were not
actively bleeding.
Other findings: Significant erythema was noted in the duodenum
c/w duodenitis. Duodenum was carefully inspected and no ulcer
was seen. Scope was advanced to D3 where bile was seen.
Impression: Old blood and clots were seen throughout stomach.
Copious irrigation of clots was performed. There were multiple
punctate areas of red blood in the fundus. These were washed and
were not actively bleeding.
Significant erythema was noted in the duodenum c/w duodenitis.
Duodenum was carefully inspected and no ulcer was seen. Scope
was advanced to D3 where bile was seen. Otherwise normal EGD to
second part of the duodenum

Recommendations: No active bleeding was seen. Bleeding may have
been due to punctate areas in fundus, gastritis, or unseen
[**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] or ulcer, although no definitive cause was found.
IV PPI twice daily.
Serial hct; transfuse as needed.
Patient will need outpatient H. Pylori testing with either
breath test or stool antigen.

=======================================

ECG - Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Normal tracing. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2125-2-12**] there is variation in
precordial lead placement. Early repolarization pattern persists
as recorded previously without diagnostic interim change. The
tracing is normal.

CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-18**], the tip
of the NG tube lies within the lower esophagus and should be
advanced at least 12-15 cm. ET tube tip is about 7 cm above the
carina. Lungs remain clear.

CXR - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
nasogastric tube has been advanced. The tip of the tube now
projects over the proximal parts of the stomach. There is no
evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
69M with history of CVA, GI bleed due to duodenal ulcer admitted
with upper GI bleed.

# GI bleed: He was admitted to the medical ICU for further
management.  There he underwent upper endoscopy under
intubation. There was no active source of bleeding identified
although it was hypothesized that bleeding may have been due to
punctate areas in the fundus, gastritis, or unseen [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
tear.  Testing for H. pylori serology was positive. He was
extubated post-procedure.  He remained hemodynamically stable
without evidence of active bleeding.  Serial hematocrits were
obtained, which were stable in the high thirties.  He was
started on high dose proton pump inhibitor twice daily.  He was
discharged with prescriptions for a PPI [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week, followed
by a two-week course of a Prevpac, for treatment of his H.
pylori. He was also instructed to call for a GI follow-up
appointment.

# Fever: Prior to being called out of the MICU, the patient was
found to have a temperature of 100.3.  There was no clear source
of infection clinically.  Urine and blood cultures were obtained
and did not reveal significant growth (there was a small amount
of bacteria on the urine cx). Potentially, this fever
represented atelectasis in the setting of his ICU stay. He
remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospitalization.

# Dementia: He was continued on aricept and citalopram. Mental
status remained at baseline, per the patient's wife.

# OSA: He was continued on home CPAP.

# Neurogenic bladder: Foley in place while he was in the MICU.
Per wife, scheduled voiding at home. Foley was d/c'ed prior to
d/c.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 M with ESRD on hemodialysis was admitted with high grade SBO
seen on CT. CT showed  dilated loops of small bowel measuring up
to 4.4 cm. Moderate ascites was noted. Two transition points
were seen in the mid abdomen involving the proximal and distal
jejunum best seen on (2:49) likely secondary to multiple
adhesions in this area.

An NG tube was placed with 500 cc of feculent material suction
out. IV recussitation was administered. Blood cultures were
sent. He was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed
an exploratory lap with lysis of adhesions and reduction of
internal volvulus for small bowel obstruction. He was given FFP
for an inr of 2.3 (on coumadin for afib)and coumadin was held.
Of note, he has a pacemaker. Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**]
operative note. Per OR note, the fascial incision was opened
down to the pubic symphysis and almost to the xiphoid process.
We took down some internal adhesions to the anterior abdominal
wall. In doing this,a large serosal tear occurred which was
repaired with a series of sutures. A large portion of the small
bowel appeared gangrenous. The bowel was de-torsed. There was
concern for the viability of the bowel and a second laparotomy
was planned. He was temporarily closed. On [**7-1**], he was taken
back to the OR where the bowel appeared viable and he was
closed. Postop, he was sent to the SICU for management. He was
kept NPO with an NG tube in place. CXR demonstrated a left lower
lobe retrocardiac opacity was new. He continued on IV
antibiotics. He was transferred out of the SICU on****

IV Cefepime,Flagyl and Vanco were administered from [**7-1**] thru
[**7-3**]. WBC had been 13.6 on admission. This decreased to 5.5 by
[**7-3**]. Blood cultures were negative and an MRSA screen was also
negative.

TPN was started on postop day 4 ([**7-3**])as he remained NPO for
bowel rest and because he was sleepy. By [**7-7**], he was passing
flatus and stool. The NG was removed. He continued to be
lethargic. Speech and swallow evaluated on [**2173-7-8**] recommending
the following:
PO diet of thin liquids and soft solids.  Select ONLY moist soft
foods. Please cut food into small, manageable pieces. Pills
whole or crushed with puree.  1:1 assistance with POs.  Give POs
only when most awake and alert.  Maintain aspiration
precautions. Q8 oral care. Diet was slowly advanced. TPN
continued. PO intake was fair. KCAL counts were ordered and
started on [**7-14**] to determine if TPN could be weaned off.

Hemodialysis was continued via the LUE AVG. Until, [**7-7**] when his
graft clotted and dialysis could not be performed. He was also
noted to be tachypnic in afib. CXR demonstrated fluid overload.
A temporary right groin line was placed and he was  dialyzed for

with adjacent basilar atelectasis.

3. 1.4 cm soft tissue density which appears to be contiguous
with the
transverse colon and may represent an inflamed diverticulum with

4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the descending aorta and
branch
vessels.

GI BLEEDING STUDY:

INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained. The patient
was again imaged dynamically for 20 one minute images at 9 hours
after the original injection. Left lateral views of the pelvis
were also obtained. at one hour, 90 minutes and at 9 hours after
injection.

Blood flow images show tortuosity of the aorta, but no bleeding
site.

Dynamic images show no active bleeding site, however left
lateral images show activity in the region of the rectum which
appears to change its configuration on each lateral view,
suggesting a rectal bleeding site



Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with a past medical history significant for DM,
HTN, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hx tachy-brady s/p
pacemaker, ESRD on HD status post recent exploratory laparotomy
for small bowel obstruction admitted with lower GI bleed.
.
Lower GI Bleed:  The patient had two large bowel movements
consistent with hematochezia at presentation.  Patient had known
diverticular disease; nasogastric lavage was negative in the ED,
and an upper GI bleed was thought to be less likely.  Patient
was receiving warfarin at rehab center prior to presentation;
all anti-coagulation was held after admission.  The patient
initially was managed in the medical ICU, and received a total
of 6 units of packed red blood cells.  His hematocrit trended
from 25.5 to 30.8, which was at his baseline.  Gastroenterology
evaluated the patient.  Given his history of diverticulosis from
a [**2167**] colonoscopy and recent exploratory surgery for a small
bowel obstruction, urgent colonoscopy was deferred, as the
patient was improving with conservative management.  After the
transfusions, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, and
was transferred from the ICU to the floor on [**2173-7-26**].  Following
transfer, the patient had two very small episodes of
hematochezia, without hemodynamic compromise.  Anti-coagulation
continued to be held.  The patient remained stable on the floor,
without any recurrence of hematochezia.  The patient will have a
colonoscopy within the next two weeks by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**], who is his
gastroenterologist.
.
Diabetes Mellitus - The patient was managed with sliding scale
humalog during his course with good glycemic control.
.
History of atrial fibrillation, status post ablation; history of
tachy-brady syndrome status post pacemaker placement:  Warfarin,
aspirin and beta-blockade was held in the setting of the lower
GI bleed.  Amiodarone was continued.  This regimen was continued
upon discharge to [**Hospital 671**] rehab.  The rehab center will contact
the patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], in one week to decide when
to restart anti-coagulation.
.
Hypertension- Metoprolol was restarted upon discharge to Radius.
.
Dyslipidemia:  Simvastatin was continued during his
hospitalization.
.
End stage renal disease on dialysis every Monday, Wednesday,
Friday:  The patient's hemodialysis schedule was continued
during his hospitalization.  Nephrocaps, renagel, and
darbopoetin were also continued.  The patient will remain on
this schedule after discharge.
.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism: Cinacelcet and Zampler were
continued.
.
Of note, the patient received a brief course of meropenem given
history of drug-resistant urinary tract infections.  This was
stopped after a urine culture was negative.

FEN- The patient was initially kept fasting, and liquids and a
regular diet was gradually re-introduced without complication.
.
Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, ppi
.
Access: A left subclavian central line that had been placed
during prior admission on [**2173-7-16**] was removed on [**2173-7-28**] prior
to discharge.

fill. Tracer activity noted in the small bowel at 18 minutes.
There is no evidence of bile leak.

Right Upper Extremity U/S ([**2173-9-9**]): No deep venous thrombosis
in right upper extremity.

Chest X-ray ([**2173-9-9**]): PICC line terminating in mid portion of
SVC. No significant interval change since [**2173-9-2**]. No
pneumothorax. Stable chest findings.




Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo M with a history of HTN, DM2, CKD, prior CVA, Afib s/p
perc chole for cholecystitis, with biliary cultures growing MDR
E.coli. Hospital course complicated by altered mental status
most likely secondary to delirium (although a new CVA cannot be
excluded), admission to SICU because  and brief episode of
hypotension at dialysis in the setting of Afib with RVR. Each of
the problems addressed during this hospitalization are described
in detail below:

Delirium: Throughout the hospital course, the patient was
confused.  On [**2173-9-1**], the patient was noted to have worsening
of mental status and was evaluated by Neurology with a concern
for a possible CVA given INR subtheraputic for procedure.
Non-contrast head CT was performed which showed no acute
intracranial bleed and old PCA infarct.  However, a new CVA
could not be excluded and MRI could not be performed as the
patient has a pacemaker. However, neurological exam remained
stable and no new focal neurological deficits were noted.
Confusion and agitation was believed to be secondary to delirium
of infectious etiology and long hospitalization.  At some points
during hospitalization, the patient became more agitated and
exhibited paranoid ideation.  He ended up pulling out his
percutaneous chole tube (see below).   He was started on
Seroquel 12.5mg daily per psychiatry recs.  EKGs were closely
monitored for QT prolongation.  The patient's agitation and
paranoid ideation have resolved prior to discharge, mental
status somewhat improved.  He no longer required restraints. The
plan is for the patient to continue on Seroquel 12.5 mg QHS.
Statin is continued.  He may be given additional 12.5mg doses of
Seroquel up to a total of 37.5mg daily.

Cholecystitis: Patient was admitted with a diagnosis of acute
Cholecystitis for which he got a percutaneous cholecystostomy
tube.  Biliary cultures grew out multi- drug resitant E. coli,
which was sensitive to Meropenem. The patient was started on
Meropenem, with a plan to complete a two week course (Day 1 =
[**2173-9-1**], last day [**2173-9-14**]).  He had a PICC tube placed in his
right arm for antibiotic delivery. At the time of discharge, the
PICC is in mid-portion of superior vena cava but chest X-ray,
can can be used as a midline for antibiotic delivery.  The
patient pulled out his percutaneous chole tube on [**2173-9-8**] while
his was agitated.  At that point, the patient was evaluated by
surgery. HIDA scan was performed, which showed no gallbladder
filling, but no evidence of bile leak, and RUQ U/S, which did
reveal persistent edema in gallbladder, but insufficient fluid
to replace a drain.  Abdominal exam continued to be benign with
was with some right upper quadrant tenderness, but no guarding
or rebound tenderness.  White blood cell counts remained stable.
 On admission, the patient with mild transaminitis, which
resolved after percutaneous chole placement.  The patient
remained stable with no signs concerning for peristent
cholecystitis or sepsis.  The patient will follow-up with his
surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for elective cholecystectomy 2 weeks after
discharge.

Afib with RVR: s/p ablation in the past. The patient had an
episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR with hypotension during
hemodialysis session early during admission. The patient was
evaluated by EP service and Echocardiogram was performed, which
revealed no new wall motion abnormalities.  Cardiac biomarkers
were negative for a myocardial infarction, Troponins were stably
elevated due to the patient's ESRD. The patient's heart rates
and blood pressures remained stable during the rest of the
admission. We continued amiodarone 100mg po daily during this
admission.  We continued rate control with Metoprolol 12.5mg po
bid with holding parameters for hypotension and bradycardia.
Later in hospitalization course, EKG showed normal sinus rhythm,
with LVH and LAD. ST segment changes likely due to
repolarization abnormality. The patient was monitored on
Telemetry and remained chest pain free throughout this
admission.  Given history of atrial fibrillation with embolic
strokes, the patient was re-started on anticoagulation with
Coumadin after percutaneous cholecystostomy with the goal INR of
[**1-19**].  At the time of discharge, Coumadin was held for 2 days for
supratherapeutic INR.  On the day of discharge, INR is 2.6 and
the patient should be restarted on 3mg of Coumadin nightly.  The
patient also was evaluated by carotid ultrasound, which revealed
bilateral carotid stenosis of <40%.

Diabetes mellitus type 2:  BG currently remained under control
during this admission.  We monitored blood glucose QID and
continued the patient on sliding scale.

Hypertension: Per neurology recommendations, systolic blood
pressure goal was 150-160 to assure sufficient brain perfusion
as the stroke could not be ruled out.  There was some difficulty
accurately measuring BP accurately because of AV fistula on left
arm, PICC in right arm, thighs and calves have not yielded
consistent BPs.
We continued Metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].

ESRD on dialysis: The patient is on dialysis on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, last HD in the morning on Friday,
[**2173-9-10**].  He has tolerated HD without complications.

Nutrition:   The patient failed speech and swallow while with
Altered Mental Status early during hospitalization course.
Dubhoff tube was placed (but was not post-pyloric).  As the
mental status improved, the patient passed speech and swallow,
and was upgraded to ground solids, thin liquids prior to
discharge.  Nutrition recommended supplementation with Ensure.
At the time of discharge, the patient's calorie counts have
remained low (300's per day), but the patient has been able to
tolerate PO intake and has complained about the taste of the
food.  We recommend no dietary restriction to facilitate PO
intake.  Given low calorie counts, the patient is being
discharged with a Dobhoff tube in place as he may need
resumption of his tube feeds if he does not take sufficient PO
intake. He will need to be monitored closely by calorie counts.


Anemia: The patient with normocytic anemia, with worsening
during this admission.  The presentation is most consistent with
anemia of chronic disease.  Hematocrit remained stable at at the
time of discharge.  The patient was Guaiac negative prior to
discharge.

Wound care: The patient has a Stage II sacral decubitous ulcer
on his buttocks.  Mepilex dressing was applied and should
continue to be applied upon discharge.
Recommendation is to cleanse with commercial wound cleanser and
change dressing every three days or as needed.

ACCESS: PICC on (placement date [**9-2**]).  Per CXR on [**2173-9-9**], tip
in mid-portion of SVC, and may be used for antibiotic delivery.

Of note, the patient had a rectal swab that was positive for VRE
during this admission.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital1 685**] [**Location (un) 686**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Cholecystitis, Delirium, Atrial Fibrillation

Secondary: Diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
prior stroke.


Discharge Condition:
Vitals stable, oxygen saturation over 95% on room air, improved
mental status


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you developed
abdominal pain.  You were found to have inflammation of your
gallbladder known as cholecystitis.  A drainage tube was placed
surgically into your gallbladder to drain the infected biliary
fluid.  You biliary fluid was infected with a bacterium that is
resistant to many types of antibiotics.  You were started on a
strong antibiotic called Meropenem that is given by IV for your
gallbladder infection.  You will need to take this antibiotic
for a total of 2 weeks.  You also had an episode of low blood
pressure during dialysis due to your atrial fibrillation with an
increased heart rate.  This resolved and has not recurred.

During your hospitalization, you became confused and agitated,
likely because of your infection.  This condition is known as
Delirium.  You were seen by Neurology to evaluate whether you
had suffered a new stroke.  At this point, it is not certain
whether or not you had a new stroke.  As you were agitated and
pulled out your drainage tube, you had to be restrained.  You
were also seen by Psychiatry doctors and started on Seroquel for
your agitation. At the time of discharge, you are less agitated
but still occasionally confused.  It is possible for your
confusion to last a few weeks even after your infection has been
treated.

At the time of discharge, your mental status is improving and
you are less confused.  You pain is under control, and you are
able to tolerate a pureed diet.

We made several changes to your medications:

1. You will need to complete a course of Meropenem mg every 12
hours.  Your last day of antibiotic treatment will be [**2173-9-14**].

2. You have been started on Seroquel, 12 mg at night for your
delirium.  This medication may be stopped at some point in the
future depending on your mental status.  You should be
reevaluated by your physician in the next week to determine
whether this should be continued.

3. Please take your other medications as directed.

You have a follow-up appointment with your surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(see below).

Should you develop fevers, worsening abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, worsening confusion or increased confusion, or any
other concerning symptoms, please call your Primary Care Doctor
or return to the Emergency Department.

CXR:
The heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous and there is
calcification within the aortic knob. Ill-defined densities
noted within the right lung base. Questinable nodular densities
are scattered through out both lungs. The left retrocardiac
density corresponds to the hiatal hernia and appears unchanged
compared to the prior study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
is detected. The soft tissue and osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Right basilar infiltrate is suggestive of peumonia.
Equivocal densities scattered through out both lungs need
further evaluation by nonurgent chest CT.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
 Innumerable nodules measuring up to 13 mm in diameter are seen
in the imaged portion of the lung bases. The imaged portion of
the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable. Several enlarged
lymph nodes, some with hypodense centers, are seen in the
pericardial fat measuring up to 15 mm in diameter. Several
peripherally located heterogeneously hypodense lesions are seen
about the right and left lobes of the liver in subserosal
location consistent with metastases. The largest of these, in
the right lobe (2:14), measures 2.6 cm in diameter. Numerous
additional nodular and irregular foci involve the peripheral
aspects of segments V, VI, IVb and [**Doctor First Name 690**].

At the gastric fundus, a heterogeneous mass measures 3.4 x 2.6
cm and protrudes into the lumen (2:18).

Numerous enlarged lymph nodes and mesenteric masses are seen
throughout the entire abdomen. Two confluent omental masses
anteriorly (2:44) measure up to 6.1 cm in diameter. Numerous
additional mesenteric lymph nodes as well as retroperitoneal
nodes along the celiac axis and in aortocaval and paraaortic
location have hypodense centers consistent with central
necrosis. These are located in the omentum anteriorly (2:27), in
the lesser sac (2:27), adjacent to the spleen and along the left
lateral peritoneum (2:27, 21), and throughout the mesenteric
root (2:45). The pancreatic duct is nondilated and no definite
pancreatic masses are identified. The adrenal glands are mildly
nodular appearing although no definite masses are identified.
Bilateral hypodense renal lesions are too small to characterize.
There is no hydronephrosis. The aorta is normal in caliber with
mural calcification consistent with atheromatous disease. A
serosal mass involving the descending colon (2:60) measures 3.5
x 3.3 cm. The colon is displaced in multiple other locations by
multiple omental and serosal masses. There is no evidence of
bowel obstruction.

CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A heterogeneous centrally
hypodense mass spans the width of the lower abdomen and pelvis,
tethering the terminal ileum and cecum as well as the sigmoid
colon, and is contiguous with the uterus and adnexa. Overall,
this mass measures up to 14 cm in greatest transaxial dimension.
The sigmoid colon is extensively encased. The bladder contains
gas, and the dome of the bladder just touches the confluent
pelvic mass. Additional nodular implants are seen in the
rectovaginal cul-de-sac (2:78).

BONE WINDOWS: No definite lesions worrisome for osseous
metastatic disease are identified. There is lumbar scoliosis and
degenerative change.

IMPRESSION:

1. Innumerable omental and peritoneal masses throughout the
abdomen and pelvis, with the largest confluent mass in the deep
pelvis.

2. 3.4 x 2.6 cm gastric fundal mass.

3. Pulmonary metastases.

4. Serosal hepatic metastases.

5. Encasement of the uterus and sigmoid colon, and questionable
involvement of the bladder, by the conglomerate pelvic mass. No
evidence of bowel obstruction.

6. Air within the bladder. Please correlate with any possible
history of recent Foley catheterization.

Possible etiologies for the extensive metastatic disease could
include gastric cancer with metastases, versus other
gastrointestinal primary with metastases, or ovarian cancer.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

COLON BIOPSIES:
Proximal sigmoid colon mass, biopsy:

Colonic mucosa with chronic active inflammation.
No neoplasm seen.
Multiple levels have been examined.
Note: Possible causes include compression from an external
lesion or an intrinsic chronic colitis.

EGD:
Normal mucosa within the esophagus, stomach and duoenum. No sign
of gastric mass.

Colonoscopy:
Partially obstructing mass noted in the proximal sigmoid colon
(40cm) covered by normal appearing mucosa. Unable to pass scope
further.


Brief Hospital Course:
GI bleed: The patient intitially presented with a GI bleed.
Based on the presentation of more maroon stool than melena, it
was felt to be consitent with a lower GI bleed. Her INR was
significantly elevated at presentation, which was felt to be
contributing significantly to her bleeding. Her INR was reversed
with 2 units of FFP and 10mg of Vitamin K. She was initially
monitored in the ICU but remained hemodynamically stable and
required no blood transfusions with a stable hematocrit after
INR reversal. She was transferred to the floor and underwent a
colonoscopy after an uneventful prep. The colonoscopy found a
partially obstructing mass in the proximal sigmoid colon with
normal appearing mucosa. It was unclear if this was an
instrinsic vs. an extrinsic colonic mass pressing in so she
underwent a CT of her abd/pelvis. This found what is likely
diffuse metastatic disease, further discussed below. Her
coumadin has been stopped secondary to her increased bleeding
risk with her abdominal malignancy and for improved quality of
life. Her hematocrit remained stable througout her admission
with no further bleeding

Abdominal malignancy: As noted above, the patient was found to
have what appears to be diffuse metastatic disease throughout
her abdomen and lower lungs. The spread was consistent with a
gastric primary. Initial biopsies from the colonoscopy returned
as normal tissue, not surprising given the mass was only
extrinsically compressing the colon. An EGD was performed which
was entirely normal, indicating that the gastric mass seen on CT
was likely extraluminal. In discussion with the patient, she did
not desire any further work up including any other biopsies. She
does not desire any surgery or chemotherapy. A palliative care
consult was called and discussed hopsice options with the
patient. Fortunately, the patient was asymptomatic in regards to
her cancer. She was without pain, N/V, able to eat normally and
have normal bowel movement.  Home hospice was set up and she was
discharged with close follow up with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also set
up with an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in GI oncology to allow her
to ask further questions or discuss further options. She was
discharged with a prescription for stool softeners.

Pneumonia/UTI: The patient initially had a leukocytosis and a
positive U/A for a UTI. She also have a RLL infiltrate seen on
CXR. These were both treated with IV ceftriaxone and
transitioned to PO cefpodoxime, to finish a brief course at
home.

HTN: Initially her HTN meds were held in the setting of the GI
bleed. After she stabilized, they were restarted at lower doses
with good effect. She will be discharged on these lower doses
and follow up with her PCP.

A.fib: The patient remain rate controlled on her beta-blocker.
Her coumadin was stopped as above. She was continued on her low
dose aspirin.

Hypothyroidism: Continued on her home dose of Synthroid with
good effect.

Coronary Artery Disease


Discharge Condition:
All vital signs stable, pain free, tolerating POs.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a GI bleed, likely from your lower
abdominal tract. This was likely caused by your elevated
coumadin level. During the work up for this, it was discovered
that you likely have metastatic cancer throughout your abdomen,
including pushing on your lower colon. As we discussed with you
and your family, we will not pursue any aggressive diagnosis,
including further biopsies. We will also not pursue chemotherapy
or surgery at this time. You will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
we will set up a follow up appointment with one of our abdominal
cancer doctors to discuss [**Name5 (PTitle) 691**] further questions you may have.

We have stopped your coumadin as the risk from bleeding is
greater due to your cancer than the risk of stroke. We have also
decreased your blood pressure medications slightly as you did
not require as much while you were in hospital.

You were also diagnosed with a mild case of pneumonia and a
urinary tract infection while here. You were initially treated
with an IV antibiotic to treat both. This was changed to an oral
antibiotic that you will finish taking at home.

In discussion with you and your family, we have arranged for you
to go home with hospice assistance for further care.

Please call your doctor or the hospice nurses if you experience
abdominal pain, bleeding, nausea/vomitting, constipation,
difficulty urinating or any other symptoms that concern you.

Followup Instructions:
Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 692**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 693**] to schedule a
follow up appointment in the next 2-4 weeks.

You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (abdominal cancer doctor)
on [**5-2**] at 2pm. Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 694**] to reschedule.

History of Present Illness:
55yoF with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**1-/2118**] found down by her
husband.

The patient has a history of depression which her husband, [**Name (NI) **],
reports has been exacerbated lately by several stressful
situations including her chronic back pain, finances, etc.  She
was last seen to be interactive and appropriate at 06:00am this
morning by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] son saw her at 11am, but thought
the patient was asleep and did not attempt to wake her.  She was
subsequently found down on the floor by her husband at 3pm, 9
hours after last being seen, who describes her as being in a
fetal position with her eyes rolled to the back of her head and
her mouth wide open.  Her husband began to lift the patient off
the floor and she bit him on the shoulder and did not appear to
recognize him.  She was take to [**Hospital6 33**] where she
was was found to be responsive to verbal stimuli but unable to
interact appropriately.  She was intubated.  Coffee grounds
returned from her OGT and she was hypotensive in the 80's/40's.
FS was 22 and received glucose, T was 94.6, and she was placed
on a bear hugger.  pH was 6.8, lacate 25, creatine 3.2, bicarb
4.  She was received 2 amps bicarb, 1 amp D50, and blood
cultures were drawn from her central line.  She was started on
bicarb drip, levophed gtt for SBP 80's.  She not making urine
after 6L IVF.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  R IJ was placed at the OSH and 2 peripheral IVs.
.
Per the husband's report, the patient does have a history of
surreptitious alcohol ingestion on occasion but he has not
noticed or detected any alcohol use recently.  He denies the
likelihood of illicit drug use or prescription drug overdose,
stating the only medication she has access to is Tramadol, which
she had not been taking.  He denies recent vocalizations by the
patient regarding suicidal ideation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS:  123   113/29   27   100%
The patient was noted to have 150cc dark coffee ground output
from her OGT, but stool was guiac negative.  Hepatology was
consulted, and the patient was started on an Octreotide gtt and
Pantoprazole gtt, and aggressive flushing of the OGT was
recommended.  She was ordered to be transfused 1 unit PRBC.  She
was empirically treated with Vanc/Levo/Flagyl and CT torso was
obtained, which showed no evidence of infection or acute bleed.
She received 8L IVF in the ED, and was increased on Levophed
0.4mcg/kg/hr.  Renal was consulted as the patient had a poor UOP
and was acidotic, and CVVH vs hemodialysis was discussed.  The
patient was given Calcium gluconate 2gm, Bicarb gtt @150cc/hr,
and was prepared for possible CVVH tomorrow.  Transfer VS were:
112/47, HR 117, 99% 60% PEEP 5, TV 450
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and opening
her eyes to verbal stimuli but not following commands.  Her
husband was available to give a brief history, which is detailed
above.

Brief Hospital Course:
55yoF with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**1-/2118**] found down by her
husband and admitted to MICU with GIB and resp failure.
Improved in the MICU and was extubated [**6-14**].  On the floor, Ms.
[**Known lastname 696**] was noted to have AMS likely [**1-18**] Korsakoff's amnesia.

1. Abdominal wall hematoma: pt began to complain of pain at site
of what was originally though to be a ventral hernia in LLQ.
the abd protrusion was palpated and had crepitus and could be
reduced, so no action was taken and mass was thought to be a
hernia at that time.  Pt was supposed to go for colonoscopy but
K+ was low, so it was delayed until [**2119-7-4**].  pt felt diarrhea
had improved this day.  Creatinine was elevated to 2.1 and this
thought to be [**1-18**] poor renal perfusion.  pt started on albumin
100mg.  Renal u/s was negative for obstruction. Her hct was 17.5
at midnight and pt received 2 units PRBC, repeat hct was 24.8.
Pt's abdominal protrusion had approx doubled in size and was
very tender.  Pt went to GI suite for colonoscopy, which did not
show a source of bleeding.  After colonoscopy, abdominal
protrusion was over twice as large as in the AM and continued to
progress rapidly throughout day.  It developed a bluish
appearance - surgery was consulted and pt sent for non con CT
which showed a hematoma.  Repeat Hct after CT was 21.0, so pt
given another unit of PRBC and also transfused 1 unit FFP, and
100mg cryoprecipitate.  Cr was down to 2.0 after albumin but
jumped again in the PM to 2.3, likely [**1-18**] ongoing blood loss.

2. post-operative course: Patient was taken for evacuation of
hematoma on [**2119-7-5**] and [**7-6**] with intraop 2L paracentesis.
Intraop: 1u prbc, 1u FFP, albumin. Patient extubated and
responsive postop. Patient transfused 2u PRBC's for Hct 25 in
setting of active bleeding. Additional 7u PRBC next 2 nights. JP
putting out sanguineous fluid, Hct decreasing. Transfused 2u
PRBC, 2 FFP, 1 cryo. Direct pressure applied to LLQ. JP Hct
sent. Ceftriaxone started for SBP per Hepatology recs.  on [**7-7**] U PRBC given, started 1/2cc per cc replacement of JP output.
UOP adequate. Pain control adequate. on [**7-8**], 2u FFP given for
INR 1.7. High JP output continued, so NS repletion increased to
cc per cc. Pt later became acutely dyspneic with desaturation to
high 70s. CXR was consistent with flash pulmonary edema. IVF
were discontinued, and pt responded well to BiPAP and 40 IV
Lasix. Pt later weaned to nasal cannula. IVF repletion of JP
output resumed at 1/2cc per cc ratio. Remained persistently
tachycardic throughout. Increasing PVCs improved with K
repletion. Regular diet started. Overnight, she had a burst of
tachycardia to the 170s, EKG unchanged and troponin was
negative. She was transferred from the ICU to the floor on [**7-10**].
She complained of shortness of breath during the day when she
was sitting but also had a component of anxiety. She ambulated,
was tolerating a regular diet, and making good urine. She
continued on her ceftriaxone. On [**7-12**], she underwent a
diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, 3L was taken off and
sent for studies, which showed clearance of her SBP. She was
switched to ciprofloxacin. She ambulated with physical therapy.
Tolerating regular diet.

3. Mental status: On transfer to the floor from MICU, the
patient was noted to be confused with AMS.  Differential was
initially anoxic brain injury vs. hepatic encephalopathy vs.
delerium vs. withdrawal.  Psych and neuro were consulted.
Benzos were weaned.  Lactulose was provided and an MRI brain
revealed no evidence of anoxic brain injury.  Given the
prominence of the patient's confabulations and the absence of
memory loss, it was suspected by neurology that the patient was
suffering from Korsakoff's amnesia.  The patient's family was
informed of this diagnosis.

4. GIB: Patient with coffee grounds out of NG tube on admission
and noted to have bright red blood coming from NG tube during
first several days of admission. She was started on Octreotide
and Pantoprazole gtt's. She was given 1u plts, 3u FFP, 3u
PRBC's, 10 mg IV Vitamin K through admission. Liver was
consulted, and felt since imaging showed patent TIPS that UGIB
from portal HTN was unlikely. Pt was eventually scoped which
showed 2cm non-bleeding ulcer with clot overlying and she was
given an NG tube holiday to prevent irritation and allow
healing. Also showed mild portal gastropathy. Hct was stable by
call out of MICU. On the floor, the patient was HD stable.  On
[**6-23**], it was noted that the patient was tachycardic to the 140s.
HCT fell from 34.4 to 28.7 and BRBPR was noted. The patient had
undergone a sigmoidoscopy to evaluate for ?ischemic colitis the
day prior without a bleeding source noted.  On the AM of [**6-23**] she
underwent an endoscopy also without evidence of a bleeding
source.  The patient was transfused with appropriate HCT
response and remained stable without BRBPR afterward.  Source of
bleeding was likely hemorrhoidal.  From [**6-27**] - [**6-29**] she was
transfused 4u pRBCs total.

5. Hypotension: Fluid resuscitated with crystalloid and colloid.
Started on Levophed gtt. Arterial line placed. She was given
broad spectrum ABx (Vanc/Zosyn) and the only culture which grew
out was MSSA in her sputum. Echo was normal. Of note, after
weaned from pressors and stabilized, necessitated diuresis for
volume overload/pulmonary edema.

6. Renal failure: Felt to be ATN due to hypotension vs HRS vs
mild rhabdomyolysis given mildly elevated CK's. She was
initially on a HCO3 gtt, and was fluid resuscitated.
Electrolytes were very abnormal (K, Phos, and Ca) and were
repleted aggressively until they normalized. She never needed
dialysis and her renal function improved.

7. Alcoholic Cirrhosis s/p TIPS:  Patient with US in the ED
showing patent TIPS. She received IV thiamine and IV Folate. She
was started on Lactulose and Rifaxamin after extubation; and
liver recommended starting Pentoxyfyline x30 days when pt able.
Repeat U/S on [**2119-7-15**] again showed patent TIPS

8. AFib: She had an episode of AFib with RVR that flipped back
to NSR with IV Metoprolol. No further issues.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 711**] is an 84 M with h/o MI, CABG, CHF presents with 4
days of worsening mildly productive cough. On the night before
admission, his cough worsened and he felt warm with a fever to
101. He tried his wife's albuterol which did not help. He denies
SOB, sore throat, congestion, chest pain, lightheadedness,
headache, dysuria/frequency, abdominal pain,

had shingles over his right eye.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 100 94 117/46 18 95/ 2LNC. Exam
bilateral rales, R>L crackles. ED staff initially felt he had a
possible LLL opacity and gave him azithro 500mg and ceftriaxone
1gm, but his final read felt there was no focal infiltrate, just
some mild vascular engorgement. His SBP was in the 120s for the
first couple of hours, and he was initially signed out to the
general medical floor, but prior to transfer, his SBP dipped to
the 80s so he was given 1 L NS plus another 500cc. His SBP
remained in the 85-95 range with sats in the mid 90s on 2-3L.
His BNP is 5805, at his baseline. His lactate was 2.9 and his Cr
3.0 (baseline around 2.5-2.8). EKG afib 78, old inf Qs,
unchanged. A UA was negative. He has 2 PIVs. He will get the
rest of his second liter on transport to the MICU.
.
On the floor, he appears well and endorses the above HPI, though
his SBP is in the 80s. He has 150cc of urine in the foley that
was placed in the ED. He is mentating well and satting in the
mid 90s on 2L.

[**2108-5-9**]: Legionella urinary antigen: negative
[**2108-5-11**]: Blood cultures x 2: no growth
.
EKG [**2108-5-9**]: Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular
response. Prior inferior myocardial infarction. Low limb lead
voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2108-4-26**] no
diagnostic interim change.
.
Imaging:
.
CXR PA and lateral [**2108-5-9**]: Heart is enlarged. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
are compatible with history of CABG. There is no evidence of
pneumonia. Reticular opacities at the lung bases likely
represent chronic lung disease, grossly unchanged since prior
exam. Hyperinflated lungs are compatible with known COPD. Study
is limited as both costophrenic angles are not included in the
image. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with no pulmonary edema or
pneumonia.
.
CXR PA and lateral [**2108-5-16**]: Since most recent prior radiograph,
there has been interval improvement of interstitial pulmonary
edema to baseline subtle mild interstitial prominence. No focal
parenchymal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Interval
development of small bilateral pleural effusions is noted. There
is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
stable demonstrating mild cardiomegaly and post-CABG and
sternotomy changes. IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of
interstitial pulmonary edema. Interval development of small
bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise, no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 711**] is an 84 yo male with history
of vascular disease, CAD, dCHF, afib who presents with cough,
fever, and low blood pressure without clear radiographic
evidence of pneumonia.
.
#. Cough/fever/shortness of breath: The patient presented with
cough and fever, suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia,
although this diagnosis was never definitely established. His
CXR showed a possible LLL infiltrate (not thought to be present
in the final read) and he was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. His sputum culture did not grow bacteria, but it
was positive for parainfluenza virus type 3. Antibiotics were
continued because of hypotension (requiring MICU
admission),suggesting possible bacterial superinfection. The
patient was treated with azithromycin, completing a 5-day
course, and ceftriaxone, with a plan to treat for 14 days. Prior
to discharge, ceftriaxone was changed to cefpodixime. The
patient will complete treatment with cefpodoxime on [**2108-5-22**].
  The patient never required intubation, but he developed
significant reactive airway disease requiring aggressive
nebulizers and chest physical therapy. His recovery was
complicated by pulmonary edema as explained below. His O2
saturations were in the low 90s for several days on 4-5L O2 by
NC. These slowly improved and by day five he was transferred to
medical floor.
  On the medical floor, the patient was hemodynamically stable.
His oxygenation improved to the low 90s on room air at rest, but
he desaturated to 86% on room air with ambulation. The patient
was persistently wheezy on pulmonary exam. He was discharged on
home oxygen, bronchodilators, and inhaled fluticasone.
.
#. Hypotension: Multiple etiologies likely contributed to the
patient's hypotension, including infection, hypovolemia, and
atrial fibrillation. The patient received 6 liters of IV fluids
during the first day of his admission. With this treatment, his
blood pressure improved. The patient's home antihypertensives
were initially held, but amlodipine, furosemide, and enalapril
were restarted prior to discharge. The patient tolerated these
medications well. Imdur and spironolactone were never restarted,
and consideration should be given to restarting these
medications in the outpatient setting.
.
#. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: BNP of
5805 is at his baseline. The patient initially appeared
hypovolemic, but after aggressive fluid resuscitation for
hypotension, he became volume overloaded. The patient was
initially treated with IV Lasix before being transitioned back
to his home regimen of Lasix 40 mg daily. The patient was still
mildly hypervolemic at the time of discharge.
.
#. Coronary artery disease: EKG and troponin were unchanged from
baseline. Continued aspirin. Held Imdur in the setting of
hypotension. Consideration should be given to restarting this
medication in the outpatient setting.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin: The patient remained in
atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation with Coumadin was
continued. The patient's INR was 1.8 at the time of discharge.
The patient was discharged on his preadmission regimen of
Coumadin 3 mg on Wednesday and Friday and 2 mg on all other
days. The patient's next INR check will be on Monday, [**2108-5-21**].
  The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is
reportedly planning for pacemaker implantation.
.
#. Wide-complex tachycardia: The patient had a single 15-beat
run of a wide complex tachycardia (non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia versus Afib/aberrency) at a rate of 160. He was
asymptomatic during this episode and had no other tachycardia
during his admission.
.
#. Chronic hypertension: The patient's home blood pressure
medications were inially held due to hypotension. Amlodipine,
enalapril, and furosemide were restarted prior to discharge but
Imdur and spironolactone will need to be restarted in the
outpatient setting.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient creatinine
was 3.0 on admission. This was thought to be due to hypovolemia.
At the time of discharge, the patient's creatinine had decreased
to 1.9, which actually below his recent baseline of 2.4 to 2.7.
The patient will need to have his renal function and
electrolytes checked on [**2108-5-21**]. The patient has a follow-up
appointment in nephrology.
.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with fever and cough. You were
diagnosed with pneumonia, and a viral called parainfluenza was
found in your sputum. You were admitted to the intensive care
unit due to low blood pressure and difficulty breathing. You
were treated with antibiotics and oxygen, with improvement in
your breathing.
.
Initially, your Lasix and several other blood pressure
medications were held, and you were given IV fluids due to low
blood pressure. As your blood pressure improved, your Lasix,
amlodipine, and enalapril were restarted. Spironolactone and
Imdur were not started prior to discharge, but you should talk
to your primary care doctor about when these medications can be
restarted.
.
At the time of discharge, you still required some supplemental
oxygen, so arrangements were made for you to use oxygen at home.
You should use your home oxygen at a rate of 2 liters per
minute. Use oxygen at night, when walking, when you have
coughing spells, and whenever you are feeling short of breath. A
visiting nurse will help monitor your oxygen level and determine
how long you will need to continue to use oxygen.
.
There have been some changes to your medications:
START cefpodoxime. Continue this until [**2108-5-22**]
START combivent inhaler
START fluticasone inhaler
START gabapentin for shingles pain
STOP Imdur (isosorbide mononitrate). Talk to your primary care
doctor about when to restart this.
STOP spironolactone. Talk to your primary care doctor about when
to restart this.
.
Weigh yourself every day. Call your doctor if your weight
increases or decreases by more than 3 pounds. Adhere to a
low-sodium diet.
.
You will need to have some labs checked on Monday [**2108-5-21**] to
monitor your kidney function, electrolytes, blood counts, and
INR.

admission to the Neurology service.  She presented with
headaches and unsteadiness the last two weeks.  Headaches are
unclear duration.  Very forgetful since [**54**]/[**2156**].  She has
been slowing down as per her family.  Being forgetful,
positive chills, no fevers, positive nausea, no vomiting,
positive diarrhea over last two to three days, cough positive
last three days.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Anxiety.
3.  Hepatitis C.
4.  Right parietal-occipital hemorrhage in 09/[**2156**].
5.  Normal stress test in 11/[**2156**].

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Keppra.
2.  Metoprolol.
3.  Epogen.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.
2.  Codeine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone; completed eighth-grade
education.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature maximum 97.8, 134/65, 80,
16, 98% on room air.  Generally sleepy; in no acute distress.
Mucous membranes moist.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Regular rate and rhythm;
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Skin:  No obvious
lesions.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, no masses.  Extremities:
Without edema; moving all extremities.  Neuro:  Arousable to
voice but falls back asleep.  Speech is sparse.  Left visual
space neglect.  Left - lot of motor
impersistence; does not consistently follow commands.
Cranial nerve, fundi, tongue midline.  Motor:  Moves all
extremities well.  Biceps and triceps [**5-9**], IP at best [**5-9**],
bilateral gastrocnemius [**6-8**] bilaterally, deep tendon reflexes
3, toes equivocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Patient's white count on admission was 8.1,
hematocrit 39, platelets 248, sodium 140, potassium 4.0, 101
chloride, 30 CO2, BUN 16, creatinine 0.4, glucose 137.

IMAGING:  CT of the head:  Right parietal temporal mass;
right to left midline shift; compression of right lateral
ventricle; right lateral ventricle dilated.

MR of the head was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  64 year old, likely primary brain tumor,
now with some headache, visual spatial defects,quick neurologic
deterioration
non-attentiveness admitted to Neurosurgery on [**2157-3-21**].
Steroids and tilt biopsy.  Keppra was continued NPO at
midnight.

The patient continued to deteriorate and remained
significantly more difficult to arouse.  At this point, after
further examining the patient, MRI was obtained which again
further delineated the primary brain tumor.  It would be most
appropriate to perform the
excision of the mass.

Patient was taken urgently to the Operating Room early the
next morning for craniotomy and the mass was removed from the
temporal parietal area.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well. Please see operative dictation.  Continued to improve.

Patient was seen on [**2157-3-23**] by Neuro-Oncology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
and was given instructions to follow up as per prognosis with
patient.

On [**2157-3-24**] dressing was removed.  Patient was
hemodynamically stable.  Diet was increased.  Patient was
seen by Endocrine on [**2157-3-24**], as well, who recommended
repeat thyroid function tests in two weeks to check for
residual endocrine abnormality but no other recommendations
prior to that.

It was decided that patient met criteria and needed to be
seen acutely in rehab.  Endocrine came back and re-evaluated
and maintained again in hypopituitary access, said there was
no evidence of hypothalamic versus pituitary abnormality.

On [**2157-3-25**] patient remained neurologically stable.  Rehab
planning was begun.  Psychiatry evaluated patient.  Their
impression was dementia due to organic process glioblastoma.
Psychiatry recommended Haldol 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. standing and
0.5 mg p.o. intravenously b.i.d. p.r.n. agitation and
avoiding benzodiazepines and anticholinergics.

Patient, on [**2157-3-26**], was offered sitters and, for greater
than 24 hours, it was decided that patient, on [**2157-3-27**],
would be able to be discharged to [**Hospital1 **] when bed became
available.  Patient needed to be screened, and insurance
issues prevented her to be discharged on [**2157-3-27**].
However, this was planned for [**2157-3-28**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable status post removal of
glioblastoma.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] regarding
glioblastoma and long-term prognosis in two weeks' time.
2.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in two weeks' time.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Brain tumor.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Change in mental status.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Endocrine abnormality.
2.  Dementia.

Date of Birth:   [**2093-2-22**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROSURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
woman with a history of right parietal occipital hemorrhage
in [**2156-10-4**].  She was admitted at that time to the
Neurology Service.

She presented with headaches and unsteadiness for the last
two weeks.  Headaches were of unclear duration, as she has
become very forgetful since [**2156-2-4**].

She has been getting lost in the grocery store, has had no
fever, positive nausea, no vomiting, positive diarrhea for
the last 2-3 days.  She has had positive chest pain on and
off, but none over the last two days prior to admission.  No
cough over the last two days prior to admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.8??????, blood
pressure 134/65, heart rate 80, respirations 16, oxygen
saturation 98% on room air.  General:  She was sleepy but in
no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive
to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Nonicteric.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin:  No obvious lesions.  Neurological:  She was arousable
to voice but then fell back to sleep.  Speech:  Sparse.
Repetition intact.  She had a left visual space neglect.  She
was impersistent with motor exam testing.  She did not
consistently follow commands.  Her pupils were 4 down to 3 mm
bilaterally.  Her face was symmetric.  Tongue midline.  She
moved all extremities well.  Triceps and biceps were 4+ out
of 5 bilaterally.  IP at least 3 out of 5 bilaterally.
Gastrocs 5 out of 5.  Deep tendon reflexes 3+ in the upper
extremities, 3 at the patella, and 2 at the Achilles.  Toes
were equivocal.

IMAGING:  The patient had a head CT that showed right
parietal temporal mass with right-to-left midline shift and
depression of the right lateral ventricle with left lateral
ventricle slightly dilated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neurosurgery Service.  She received an MRI.  The patient's
mental status deteriorated.  She became unresponsive with a
blown right pupil.  The patient was taken to the Operating
Room emergently for craniotomy for excision and biopsy of the
tumor.

The patient underwent a right parietal temporal craniotomy
for excision of tumor without intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively the patient was monitored in the Recovery
Room over night.  Her vital signs were stable.  She awakened
easily to voice, saying her name.  Pupils were 6 down to 5 mm
bilaterally to ambient light.  She withdrew briskly in her
upper and lower extremities.

On postoperative day #1, she was awake and alert.  Pupils
were 5 down to 4 mm.  She had a left neglect visually.
Strength was symmetric.  Finger flexors and IPs bilaterally.
She was improved and was much more awake and alert.

The patient was seen by Neuro-oncology who recommended
Radiation/Oncology and possible chemotherapy.  She was
transferred to the regular floor on postoperative day #1.
She was out of bed and ambulating.  She was assessed by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and found to
require a short rehabilitation stay prior to discharge to
home.

She was also seen by Endocrine due to the mass near her
hyperthalamus.  TSH was slightly decreased with a normal T4.
Endocrine recommended follow-up on PFTs in two weeks.

The patient was therefore prepared for rehabilitation and
discharged to rehabilitation on [**2157-3-30**], with
follow-up in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic on Monday for staple
removal.

Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 yo F with a history of DM2 and HTN who presents
with L greater than R flank pain, associated with nausea and
visual blurring. Patient has had L sided flank pain since the
night prior to admission. This was associated with blurry vision
for the past 1-2 days, and headache over the last few hours. She
has not had dysuria, hematuria, vomiting, or fevers. No
abdominal pain. No diarrhea.

She does have a history of HTN and is compliant with her
antihypertensives.

Of note, she had much more severe flank pain 6 weeks ago. She
was told to drink fluids for potential kidney stone. She had
imaging done in [**State 760**], at her home, that showed no obvious
stones. Apparently she was referred to a nephrologist at that
time and was told she had some evidence of kidney failure. She
was first told she may have kidney failure in [**2198-4-22**]. She was
seen by nephrology, but does not know any further details. She
has never been on dialysis before. She did not have this flank
pain at that time.

Patient brought labs from previous appointments.

Urine cytology ([**3-21**]) - pending

STUDIES:
CT abd/pelvis ([**3-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of diverticulosis or urinary tract calculi.
2. Unchanged large calcified fibroid uterus.
3. 2.9-cm low-attenuation left renal lesion larger than prior
study. Further evaluation with MR would be optimal. However,
given the patient's renal failure, US as an initial study is
recommended.

Head CT ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Sclerotic focus in the left humeral head, could reflect a
bone island given lack of underlying risk factors for
metastasis. Correlation with prior imaging to confirm stability
is recommended.

Renal US and doppler ([**3-19**]):
FINDINGS: There is a partly cystic/partly solid isoechoic mass
again seen in the mid portion of the left kidney which
corresponds with the recent CT
findings. This mass measures 3.4 x 2.7 x 2.8 cm and demonstrates
some
vascular flow within it on color Doppler imaging. The appearance
of this mass may be suggestive of cystic renal cell carcinoma.
No additional focal
abnormality is seen in the left kidney and there is no
hydronephrosis. The
left kidney measures 9.2 cm. The right kidney measures 10.0 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis and no stone or mass is seen in the
right kidney.

DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images
were
obtained. Arterial waveforms of the main renal artery in the
right kidney
demonstrates a slight delay in upstrokes which may indicate some
renal artery stenosis. Sharp upstrokes are identified in the
arterial waveform of the renal artery in the left kidney.
Resistive indices of the intraparenchymal arteries on the right
kidney are slightly elevated ranging from .78-.80. The resistive
indices of the intraparenchymal arteries in the left kidney are
also slightly elevated ranging from .73-.83.

IMPRESSION: 1) Slight upstroke delay of the arterial waveforms
in the main
renal artery of the right kidney may indicate some renal artery
stenosis on the right side. Bilateral moderately elevated RI's.
2. Cystic and solid mass in the mid-left kidney, concerning for
neoplasm.

Bone Scan ([**3-21**]): No scintigraphic evidence of osseous
metastatic disease.

Renal Scan ([**3-26**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Reduced renal function bilaterally consistent with chronic
renal
impairment.
2. Differential renal function of 39% left kidney and 61% right
kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo F with hypertensive urgency found to have a new renal
mass.

# Renal mass:  The patient was found to have a new renal mass on
the CT of her abdomen/pelvis done in the ED to evaluate her
flank pain.  On ultrasound the mass was seen to be approximately
2x2x3 cm and had both solid and cystic portions.  The size and
characteristics of the mass are concerning for renal cell
carcinoma.  Her renal mass was thought to account for her flank
pain.

On her admission CXR she was found to have a sclerotc focus in
her left humeral head which was concerning for metastesis.  This
was evaluated with a bone scan which showed no evidence of
metastesis.  Urology was consulted and felt that more
information was needed before a definitive plan for diagnosis
could be developed so a renal scan was preformed to assess the
functionality of her kidneys and showed differential renal
function of 39% from the left kidney and 61% from the right
kidney.

Because she currently has [**State 760**] Medicaid, we were unable to
schedule outpatient follow-ups for her with doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 764**].  Once she moved back to [**State 350**] she was
asked to contact Financial Services at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 765**] to apply
free care through this hospital.  However she was asked to
follow up with her PCP in NJ until this time and an appointment
was made for her with her NJ PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] [**4-1**] at 1:00 PM.
He was contact[**Name (NI) **] and asked to give her a referral to a
nephrologist and urologist in [**State 760**] until she moves her
care to [**State 350**].

# Hypertensive urgency: Her initial BP was 221/71 with worsening
of visual blurring and flank pain. No papilledema on exam.
Patient reports SBPs in 180s for several months and her PCP
notes confirm this.  She states she had been taking her blood
pressure medications regularly, however her PCP notes document
that she often runs out of her medicaitons and has difficulty
regularly taking her medications.  She was on maxed doses of
linsinopril and diovan as an outpatient and large doses of
atenolol.  In the ED she was placed on a labetalol gtt with
decrease in her SBPs.  Renal was consulted and recommended only
starting the lisinopril as it was unclear how compliant she had
been on her previous regimen.  As she remained hypertenisve on
lisinopril, long-acting dilitazem was added and uptitrated to
240 mg daily.  Atenolol was stopped given that it is renally
cleared and diovan was stopped.  She may continue to require
titration of her antihypertensive medications as an outpatient.

# Chronic renal failure: The patient had an admission creatinine
of 3.4. Patient had brought labs with her showing Cr 3.0-3.29 in
[**2198-12-23**]. FENA of 4.24 consistent with intrinsic or
postrenal etiology. This may be consistent with chronic diabetic
or hypertensive nephropathy. CT abdomen showed no stones, or
obvious obstruction. Renal was consulted and recommended
starting sodium bicarbonate 650 mg tid, vitamin D.  She was
given epo while hospitalized for anemia, however this was
stopped at discharge due to concern for insurance reimbursement.
 She was asked to follow up with a nephrologist for further
managment of her renal disease.

# Normocytic Anemia: HCT 30.8. HCT of 31.1 on [**2199-1-20**]. Likely
anemia of chronic renal disease.  She had no evidence of
bleeding.  She was treated with epo per renal as above.  This
remained stable.

# MGUS: As part of the workup for her chronic renal
insufficiency UPEP and SPEP were sent which returned showing a
monoclonal IgG lambda protein spike.  Hematology/oncology were
consulted to ascertain the significance of this finding and they
felt this represented MGUS because the level of protein seen was
small.  There is concern that her kidney disease could be due to
amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease, however a kidney
biopsy would be necessary to diagnosis this and at this time
cannot be preformed given her renal failure.  She will need
yearly UPEP and SPEP to monitor for developement of multiple
myeloma.

# Type 2 Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.
 This was held while she was hospitalized and she was covered
with a sliding scale, monitored with qid fingersticks, and kept
on a diabetic diet.

# Code: Full code

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary -
Renal mass concerning for renal cell carcinoma
Hypertensive urgency
Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance
Chronic renal insufficency, Stage IV

Secondary -
Diabetes


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to elevated blood pressure
and back pain.  Your blood pressure was controlled with
medications.  Your scans showed a mass in your left kidney which
was concerning for cancer.  We were also concerned about a mass
seen on your left arm X-ray.  A bone scan done for this was
normal, which is good.

For the kidney mass, we contact[**Name (NI) **] the urologists, who specialize
in kidney surgery.  We did a special kidney scan to take a
closer look at the kidney mass.  You will need to see the
urologists (kidney surgeons) in follow-up after you get
discharged from the hospital.

While you were hospitalized you were also found to have abnormal
protein in your blood and urine.  The cancer specialists were
called and felt you have a disease called Monoclonal Gammopathy
of Unknown Significance (MGUS).  People with this condition have
a small chance of developing a cancer of the blood called
multiple myeloma and need to be screened yearly to check for
this.

Due to your chronic kidney failure you should avoid taking
antiinflammatory medications such as Motrin, Alleve, ibuprofen,
or naproxen.  For pain you can take Tylenol or ask your primary
care physician what to take.

Medication changes:
1.  You were started on diltiazem 240 mg by mouth daily.  You
should take this in addition to lisinopril 40 mg daily for
control of your blood pressure.  It is very important that you
take these medications regularly.
2.  Your diovan and atenolol were stopped.
3.  You were started on sodium bicarbonate 650 mg by mouth three
times daily due to your kidney disease.
4.  You were started on Vitamin D

Followup Instructions:
Because you currently have [**State 760**] Medicaid, we were unable
to schedule outpatient follow-up for you with doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 764**].  Once you have a place to live in [**State 350**],
you will need to contact Financial Services at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 765**] to
apply free care through this hospital.  However, until that is
arranged, you will need to continue seeing your doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
[**Name5 (PTitle) **].

An appointment was made for you to follow up with your primary
doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 760**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for a blood pressure and blood
work check on Monday [**4-1**] at 1:00 PM.  You will also need to
ask him for a referral to a kidney specialist (nephrologist) and
a kidney surgeon (urologist) in [**State 760**].

As you will be moving to [**State 350**] soon you can schedule an
appointment with a new primary doctor at [**Hospital6 **]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]) once the above are resolved.

It is important that you follow up with urology to discuss a
plan for diagnosis and management of your renal mass.  If you
will be getting care in [**State 350**], please schedule an
appointment with a urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**], at [**Hospital1 771**]: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 772**].

You will also need to follow-up with your nephrologist in New
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **].  If you will be transferring your care to [**State 350**],
you can make an appointment with kidney doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 771**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 773**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Last Name (un) 159**] after undergoing laparoscopic
Right radical nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events
occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. The
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The
patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition for
monitoring due to extensive comorbidities and not for any
intraoperative complication.  On POD0, pain was well controlled
on PCA, hydrated for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with
pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis, and
ambulated once. She was seen by the cardiology service and the
nephrology service and underwent HD while int he ICU.  On POD1,
the patient was restarted on home medications, basic metabolic
panel and complete blood count were checked, pain control was
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, Foley was removed
without difficulty and diet was advanced as tolerated. Prior to
discharge the patient underwent a CT scan with contrast of the
chest to evaluate pulmonary nodules seen on CXR.  She underwent
HD after this.  The remainder of the hospital course was
relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in 3 weeks
and to also call for follow-up with nephrology and cardiology.

History of Present Illness:
61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage IV NSLC lung cancer
(EGFR wild type), DM2, HTN who presents with respiratory
distress.

Patient was with cough and not feeling well this AM. She went to
dialysis where she was coughing intensely to the point that the
needles came out of her AV graft. She appeared short of breath.
Unclear what EMS course was. Upon presentation to the ED, her
eyes were open but she was none verbal. Some history obtained by
cousin in [**Name (NI) **].

Of note, her lung cancer involves the right upper lobe mass and
adjacent hilar/mediastinal/supraclavicular nodes. Patient met
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) **], who started vinorelbin for
palliative chemotherapy about 2 weeks ago.

In addition, patient's admit weight was 62 kg with an estimated
dry weight of 58 kg.

ED Course:
Initial VS at 11:40 on [**10-21**] were T 97.7 HR 100 BP 181/69 RR 32
Sat 84 %. She triggered for respiratory distress. Eyes were open
but non-verbal. There was a question about intubation/code
status. ED physician spoke to next of [**Doctor First Name **] (Mr.[**Last Name (Titles) 732**]). He stated
that she would want to be intubated. Intubated with 7.5 ETT with
ricironium 60 mg and etomidate 20 mg. Sedation with versed and
propofol. After intubation, VS were 95, 125/59, 25, 99% on vent

CXR revealed RUL opacity. She was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1
and levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1 initially followed by addition of
vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1 to cover HCAP. EKG showing Sinus Tach,
TWI V4-6, ? peaked T's.

.
On the floor, patient was sedation and tolerating ventilator
well. Renal was consulted for HD but noticed left graft not
functioning. Placed RIJ line for dialysis access. Dialysis was
going to be performed but hypotensive to MAPs ~ high 50s. CVP 4.
Propofol was switched to versed/fentanyl. Dialysis was not
performed. Patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with BAL
showing RL apical segmental occlusion (? tumor), 90 % anterior
segment occlusion, and patent posterior segment. Pressure
subsequently in 180s.

BRONCHIAL WASHING [**2200-10-21**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

ADMISSION EKG [**2200-10-21**]
Sinus tachycardia. Intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular
hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to
intraventricular conduction
delay, left ventricular hypertrophy and possible ischemia.
Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2200-7-29**]
sinus
tachycardia is now present and ST-T wave abnormalities are more
prominent.

CHEST X RAY [**2200-10-21**]
IMPRESSION: Multiple limitations as above. There is diffuse and
severe
pulmonary edema. A dense consolidation on the right may indicate
confluent
edema, although pneumonia or underlying mass lesion cannot be
excluded.

ECHO [**2200-10-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= XX
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is
seen (within normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with moderate to severe global
hypokinesis. Lateral wall function is relatively better. No
significant mitral regurgitation seen.

CHEST X RAY [**2200-10-24**]
There is now complete opacification of the right upper lung with
increase of
the right mediastinal shift. The findings are consistent with
interval
development of atelectasis but there is potentially some
additional cause that
precludes significant volume loss such as hemorrhage.
Correlation with
bronchoscopy is highly recommended. Position of tubes and lines
and the left
perihilar region opacities are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage
IV NSCLC involving RUL, DM2, HTN who presents with acute
hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress and RUL opacification
secondary to possible post-obstructive pneumonia in addition to
initial neutropenia.
.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress
Ms. [**Known lastname 784**] was originally intubated and ventilated in the ICU
setting upon admission.  After initially failing pressure
support trial, she was ultimately able to be extubated on
[**2200-10-23**] after a discussion with the family concluded that if
Patient extubated initially failing trial of pressure support.
Cause of the respiratory distress thought to be likely
multifactorial with RUL opacification representing
post-obstructive pneumonia given bronchscopy and ? pulmonary
edema contribution although not clinically evident
(?lymphangitic spread of cancer).  Per goals of care
conversation with the family and HCP, the decision was made to
not reintubate, and ultimately, she was made CMO.  She was kept
comfortable with morphine concentrated oral solution and
scopolamine patch was used for secretion control.  She was
started on a morphine gtt with bolus morphine for breakthrough
[**12-24**] tachypnea on [**2200-10-27**]. The patient passed away on [**2200-10-27**].
.
# Sepsis secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia with subsequent
pan-sensitive E. Coli bacteremia. Patient with leukocytosis and
fever (100.7) during MICU stay.  She was originally treated with
vanc/levofloxacin however this was changed to Zosyn after cx
data returned.  Upon admission, she was neutropenic [**Last Name (un) 834**]
vinrelbin chemo 2 weeks PTA. This resolved over time.  The
source of her bacteremia was thought most likely [**12-24**] pulmonary
system.  After the decision was made to become CMO, antibiotics
were discontinued and she was kept comfortable with tylenol
liquid prn for fever.
.
# Non-gap mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
Metabolic acidosis resolved s/p dialysis. Continued to have
respiratory acidosis likely secondary to hypoventilation
post-extubation.  ABGs and blood draws to monitor lytes and K
were discontinued after the patient was made CMO.
.
# Hypotension: Patient had issues with pre-load dependent
hypotension during her MICU course. Patient appeared adequately
resuscitated and a recent ECHO showed moderate to severe
hypokinesis, which may represent myocardial depression [**12-24**] to
sepsis and acute illness vs. baseline heart disease.  After the
patient was made CMO, dialysis was discontinued and vital signs
were no longer taken.

# EKG changes: TWI different from prior on admission. In state
of acute illness, demand ischemia possible. EKG changes resolved
by morning. Troponins bland. Acute plaque rupture very unlikely.
Many of her cardiac medications were stopped during her MICU
stay, and were not restarted given her CMO status (ASA, plavix,
lipitor, heparin gtt, ACE/BB).
.
# Chronic kidney disease requiring HD.  HD was performed by
renal during her MICU stay.  Medications were renally dosed, and
nephrotoxins and IV contrast were avoided in the setting of CKD.
 HD was discontinued when the patient was made CMO.
.
# Stage IV NSCLC
- discussed with primary oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who thinks
chemotherapy unlikely to provide patient any benefit.
.
# Anemia
Baseline Hgb ~ 11. Current stable around ~ 8. No evidence of
acute blood loss.
This was trended, but after the patient was made CMO, no more
labs were checked.
.
# Chronic heart failure, systolic, EF 30 % with MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] does
not have active signs of heart failure although transient
diastolic function can cause pulmonary edema. ECHO showed
resolving MR.
.
# History of reactive airway disease: continued on ipratropium
nebs, until CMO status, at which point they were d/c'ed as
family felt pt did not derive help with them.
.
# Diabetes - pt did not receive oral hypoglycemics, but rather
was placed on a SSI until this was stopped when she was made
CMO.
.
# Goals of care
Multiple family meetings held (see ICU attending note for more
details). Per HCP, DNR/[**Name2 (NI) 835**] with no pressors. Given that her
health deteriorated during her MICU stay, the patient was made
CMO by the family including her HCP in light of the
post-obstructive pneumonia difficult to treat in the setting of
Stage IV NSCLC.  She was transferred to the medicine floor after
lines were d/c'ed.  All vital sign checks and lab draws were
discontinued, and the family remained at the bedside.  The
patient was prescribed only medications for comfort, which
included tylenol liquid, morphine sulfate concentrated oral
solution, ativan, and haldol.
.
Of note, SW saw the pt and provided counseling to the family
throughout her stay on [**Wardname 836**].

Date of Birth:  [**2077-7-13**]        Sex:  M

Service:  CCU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old man with
severe CAD, status post CABG in [**2135**] with recent PCI to the
LMCA and SVG to the PDL in [**2143-7-14**].  He presented on
[**2143-8-23**] for an elective intervention brachytherapy of the
SVG to PL and native RCA.  The patient reported that he had
been feeling well without chest pain, shortness of breath, or
dyspnea on exertion.  He was noted to have an ejection
fraction of greater than 60 percent in [**2143-7-14**].  The
patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on the morning of
arrival with PCI to the native RCA and 4 stents and
brachytherapy to the vein graft.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and approximately 6 hours later developed a
chest pain noted as 4 out of 10 substernal radiating to his
throat and back without shortness of breath, diaphoresis,
nausea or vomiting.  EKG at that time revealed ST elevation
in II, III, and aVF.  The patient was brought back to the
catheterization laboratory at that time.  They found that the
SVG to PL have been thrombosed.  The artery was opened in the
catheterization laboratory, AngioJet had been unsuccessful
and the graft was opened with Nipride with subsequent TIMI 3
flow.  The patient had persistently occluded communication
between the native RCA and the vein graft.  Postprocedure,
after the sheath pull, a hematoma developed and the patient
had baseline low blood pressure of systolic in the 90s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Status post MI in [**2129**].
2. PCI to the LAD in [**2130**].
3. PCI to the RCA in [**2132**], complicated by a stent blocking
   the femoral artery.
4. Status post iliac repair.
5. Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2135**] including LIMA to the
   LAD, SVG to the D1, SVG to the RPL.
6. PCI to the LMCA in [**2143-7-14**], PCI to the SVG to the PVL.
7. Status post right knee arthroscopy.
8. History of hemorrhoids.
9. History of benign polyps.


MEDICATIONS ON PRESENTATION:
1. Aspirin 325 mg a day.
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
3. Zocor 60 mg a day.
4. Plavix 75 mg a day.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smokes 10 packs a week for the past 50
years, currently trying to quit.  Social tobacco with no
illicits.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A brother died of MI at age 60.  Father had
his first MI in his 50s.  The patient is married with several
children.  He is currently between jobs.  After the
procedure, the patient was admitted to the CCU for
monitoring.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature was 98.2 degrees,
blood pressure 99/48, respiratory rate 15, 100 percent
saturation on room air, heart rate 57 to 66.  In general, he
is a well-appearing elderly male, alert and oriented with an
appropriate affect.  HEENT revealed no JVD.  Supple neck.
Chest revealed clear lungs, no rhonchi, no crackles.
Cardiovascular normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops,
no S3 or S4.  Abdomen is flat, soft, nontender, nondistended,
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm with
capillary refill less than 3 seconds, 2 plus DP and PT and
radial pulses, no edema, left groin with bruit.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG on presentation had a sinus rate of 55,
inferior T-wave inversions, ST elevation in V1 and V2.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 66-year-old male with a severe
CAD, status post brachytherapy, SVG to the PDL with
subsequent thrombosis, status post opening of the artery
during repeat catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was now hemodynamically stable
with resolution of his EKG changes and ST elevation and he
was admitted to the CCU for monitoring.  That evening, the
patient complained of back pain on his left side, which he
attributed to lying on his back.  On exam, there was no
palpable hematoma, no bruit auscultated and strong DP pulses
with warm extremities.  The CT of the pelvis and abdomen was
negative for retroperitoneal bleed.  It was determined that
the patient's pain was due to back pain; however, the concern
for his low blood pressure, lack of evidence for
retroperitoneal bleed.  The patient was bolused 250 cc of IV
fluid and blood pressure increased to a range of 98 to
106/50s to 60s.  The patient was also noted to have
hematocrit of 29.5, he was transfused 1 unit.  After his
catheterization, the patient had prolonged groin bleeding
requiring a clamp; as stated the ultrasound was noted a small
hematoma without aneurysm and a CT was negative for
retroperitoneal bleed.  The patient had been having low blood
pressure persistently.  There was no evidence of a tamponade,
no evidence for bleeding, no evidence for adrenal
insufficiency and the patient responded well to small boluses
of fluid.  This was presumably all due to preload dependent.
The patient had 3 beats of NSVT on telemetry and otherwise
was feeling quite well; had no recurrence of chest pain.
Given persistent hypotension, the patient remained in the
intensive care unit for 24 more hours.  He was given a
cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out adrenal
insufficiency.  It was inconclusive.  He was given
hydrocortisone 100 mg for empiric treatment and there was no
effect on blood pressure; therefore, it was determined that
it was highly unlikely his low blood pressure was due to
adrenal insufficiency and likely was extensive vagal
phenomenon from pressure on the groin status post procedure.
Given that the patient was doing well, he was transferred out
to the floor on day 3.  Blood pressure remained low at
90s/60s.  The patient continued to receive boluses with mild
effective increase; however, the patient had profoundly good
urine output and urine lytes that supported the patient being
euvolemic.  The patient ambulated well, had no complaints.
He was restarted back on his home medications including his
blood pressure medications.  For his coronary artery disease,
which was extensive, the patient's CK has declined, he was
maintained on aspirin, Plavix and Lipitor at 80.  He was
restarted on his Lopressor before going home and tolerated
that well without any difficulty with hypotension.  The
patient was consulted extensively on smoking cessation.  The
patient had a repeat echocardiogram that revealed an EF 50 to
55 percent, mild inferior wall hypokinesis compared to the
previous study and it was hoped that he would restart on Ace
inhibitor and titrated up on that in time as his blood
pressure tolerated as an outpatient.  For anemia, the
patient's hematocrit remained stable.  It was determined that
he has a small arterial bleed status post catheterization;
received 1 unit of blood.  No evidence of AV fistula.  The
patient was instructed to have his hematocrit followed up by
his primary care doctor.  The patient's hypotension was
determined to be due to vagal phenomenon.  The patient was
near his baseline blood pressure.  There was no evidence of
adrenal insufficiency and the patient was asymptomatic.  He
was discharged with plans to have his blood pressure checked
and to titrate up his medications as tolerated.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged to home
with instructions to take Plavix every day as ordered or
stent would close.  He was instructed to never smoke again.
He was instructed regarding his new medications.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Acute stent thrombosis, status post cardiac
   catheterization and stenting.
3. Anemia due to blood loss.
4. Groin hematoma.
5. Hypotension.
6. Hypokalemia.
7. Tobacco use.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to followup with his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 837**], on [**2143-11-27**].  He was instructed to
have another stress test according to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 837**] on [**2143-11-18**].
He was instructed to call his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old
young lady with a history of hypothyroid, previous
appendectomy and hysterectomy who presented to the Emergency
Department with a one day history of severe abdominal pain.
The patient endorses nausea without vomiting, sweating,
dysuria, chest pain, and shortness of breath.  The patient
did not have any prior episodes of this type of pain.  The
patient has no history of ulcers.  The patient's last bowel
movement was [**8-14**], it was normal.  The patient
tolerated breakfast by mouth today without any complications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient
was afebrile 100.0, heartrate 80, blood pressure 148/74,
respiratory 24, 99% on room air.  In general she was alert
and oriented times three.  Cardiac examination was irregular.
Chest examination with a fair amount of air entry.  Abdominal
examination, tenderness, guarding mainly in the right lower
quadrant.  Positive tympani.  Extremities were warm, no edema
or erythema.  Rectal examination, guaiac negative.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed white
count 13.7, hematocrit 42, platelets 397, sodium 139,
potassium 4.1, chloride 97, bicarbonate 34, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 127.  Liver function tests, ALT 16,
AST 28, alkaline phosphatase 78, total bilirubin 0.5, amylase
43.  Urinalysis, trace leukocytes, small blood, trace
ketones, red blood cells [**2-13**] and white blood cells [**2-13**].
Chest x-ray showed free air in his diaphragm on the right.
Abdominal x-rays, upright film showed free air with air in
the colon.  Stool absent all the way down through the colon.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and placed on
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  Blood cultures were
sent.  On hospital day #1, [**2188-8-15**], the patient
underwent partial gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy with
placement of feeding J-tube for a perforated gastric ulcer.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
complications during the surgery.  The patient was placed in
the Intensive Care Unit over night, intubated.  On [**2188-8-16**], postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned from
ventilator support and extubated without difficulty.  The
patient's renal function improved to producing over 30 cc/hr
and soft bowel sounds were appreciated.  On postoperative day
#3 the patient was transferred to the floor.  On the floor,
the patient was started on half-strength tube feeds.  Total
parenteral nutrition was continued and by [**8-21**],
postoperative day #6 the patient was tolerating sips.  On the
day of [**8-20**], the patient had one episode of atrial
fibrillation that was successfully controlled with
intravenous Lopressor.  By [**8-22**], the patient was
tolerating liquids without difficulty.  Total parenteral
nutrition had been stopped, antibiotics had been stopped and
rehabilitation planning had started.  Tube feeds were
increased to almost goal.  On [**8-23**], the patient was
tolerating full liquids without difficulty and was discharged
to rehabilitation.  The patient will be discharged to
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation in good condition.  She is able to
ambulate with assistance, tolerate full liquids and has no
further need for antibiotics.

IMAGING:
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**6-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of fecal packing within the colon throughout the
colon. Mild to moderate dilitation of several loops of jejunum
with concern for partial obstruction. Complete obstruction is
not present as some contrast travels into the proximal colon.
2. Large fluid distention of the stomach with reflux of fluid
into the distal esophagus. Placement of NG tube is recommended
for decompression. A proximal obstruction cannot be excluded as
contrast was administered through the jejunostomy tube.

Abdominal XRay ([**6-22**]):
IMPRESSION:
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. There are dilated loops of small
bowel within the abdomen as well as air and stool seen
throughout the colon.

CXR ([**6-23**]): FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study
from [**2164-6-22**].
There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 4.7 cm above the
carina
appropriately sited. The left-sided IJ central venous catheter
has the distal tip in the proximal SVC and is also unchanged.
Since the previous study, there has been development of diffuse
airspace opacities, mostly at the lung bases, which can be
compatible with the suggested history of aspiration. No
pneumothoraces are seen.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**6-25**]): CONCLUSION:
1. Significant small bowel dilatation. The configuration raises
the
possibility of a closed loop obstruction. with narrowing of a
single segment, concerning for obstruction. Interval development
of ascites may also support small bowel obstruction.
2. Bilateral airspace consolidation.
3. Interval development of ascites.

Abdominal Pathology ([**6-27**]): Ileum, segmental resection:
1.  Ischemic enteritis with stricture.
2.  Proximal dilation and focal hemorrhage.
3.  The margins are free of disease.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**7-10**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Marked interval improvement in the small-bowel obstruction
noted on [**2164-6-25**] with passage of contrast predominantly up
to the splenic flexure of colon.
2. Apparant 2.1 X 4.4 cm loculated fluid collection as described
above could represent a fluid filled pelvic ileal loop. Short
term follow-up pelvic CT with oral contrast to evaluate for
change or filling is suggested to aid differentiaion.
3. Improved bibasilar atelectasis and patchy ground glass and
tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities suggesting resolving infectious process. New small
bilateral pleural effusions are noted.

CT Pelvis ([**7-11**]):
IMPRESSION: The previously described possible fluid collection
on today's
study appears to be a loculated pocket of ascites or intrapelvic
abscess
measuring 2.7 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm (AP, transverse, craniocaudal). No
other short term interval changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SBO:
Pt was initially found to not have an obstruction or
intra-abdominal free air. Pt was made NPO with an NGT and IVF.
The patient pulled out his NGT and was subsequently placed on UE
restraints. The NGT was not replaced as the patient subsequently
had copious large bowel movements initially. At the time, Pt's
lab values during the initial period, including CBC and
electrolytes were all normal throughout the hosptial course.
However, over the next few days, he continued to have trouble
with SBO, and a significant high-grade bowel obstruction distal
from the J-tube site was found on Abd CT on [**6-25**]. We tried to
care for this with 2 days of
conservative therapy, including venting of the J tube and NG
decompression. There was clearly no progression of his
distention, and he was not making bowel movements, and since he
is noncommunicative, the decision was made to not delay any
further and operate on him.
On [**6-27**], he went to the OR for:
1. Small bowel exploratory laparotomy.
2. Small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis.
Post-operatively, an NGT was placed, and he was put on bowel
rest. By [**7-2**], he was passing stools, and his NGT output was
decreased until it came out and it was not replaced. Tubefeeds
through J tube were restarted on [**7-3**] and his goal was met on
[**7-5**]. He did fail a swallow study on [**7-4**], and he has remained
NPO. He did have some anemia to 20.8 on [**7-3**], and was given
2URBCs which he responded well to.

The patient seemed to be more somnolent and less responsive on
[**7-10**], and he had a repeat CT abdomen/pelvis which showed
interval improvement in his SBO, but also a 2.1 X 4.4 cm
loculated fluid collection as described above could represent a
fluid filled pelvic ileal loop. A subsequent Pelvic CT with PO
contrast showed a loculated pocket of ascites or intrapelvic
abscess measuring 2.7 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm. The surgeons (including
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] reviewed the films and determined that this was
unlikely to be an abscess, and there was no need to take him for
CT guided drainage or back to the OR.

2. C. Difficle Colitis:
On HD 2 the patient was found to have stool positive for C.Diff.
He was started on flagyl PO 500 TID for a course fo 2 weeks then
switched to PO vancomycin 250mg every 6 hrs on [**6-17**] for total 14
day treatment.  Pt completed his course of PO vanco on [**7-1**], and
was not having diarrhea at that time. Repeat C. diff stool
cultures on [**8-17**], [**7-5**], and [**7-11**] were negative.

3. Seizures:
The patient was found to be tachycardic and hypertensive on HD
2. In context of his PMH, it was believed that he likely had a
seizure. It was noted that he was having between 1 and 3
seizures daily at his current home prior to admission. Dilantin
levels were checked daily and often found to be subtherapeutic.
400 mg boluses of dilantin were given accordingly and the
neurology service at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted for appropriate
management of his seizures. The patient was transferred to the
Neurology service on HD4.

While on neuro service, he had no increase in his usual seizure
frequency.
Post-operatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on IV Dilantin and
Lorazepam, and his dilantin levels were followed. By [**7-5**], he
was restarted on Dilantin, Lorazepam, Felbatol, and Trileptal
through J tube per Neurology.

His Keppra was discontinued during this hospitalization. His
Phenytoin was changed to 100 mg three times a day. His Trileptal
was kept at 300-600-300, and his Felbatol was kept at 1400 mg
[**Hospital1 **]. He was started on Ativan 1 mg PO q8 hr. IN ONE WEEK THIS
SHOULD BE TAPERED TO 1 MG PO Q12 HR, and will be further
titrated during his follow up appointment with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 856**].

4. Upper GI Bleed: On [**6-22**], pt had black vomitus which was
guaiac positive hence NGT was placed and pt had copious black
fluid output which was once again guaiac positive.  Pt did not
have any IV access and peripheral access could not be obtained
hence L IJ central line was placed per medical procedure team.
Pt had stat CBC, type and screen and IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] was started and
GI was consulted who recommended CT scan to rule out
obstruction.  Surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] given that pt was initially
admitted per surgery and recently had ex-lap, cholecystectomy
and open j tube placement per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Pt became
hemodynamically unstable with decreasing BP and tachycardia plus
decreased urine output, pt was transferred to MICU for intensive
care.

5. Aspiration Pneumonia: While in the MICU, he developed
respiratory failure, which was likely aspiration given
significant amounts of gastric contents from OG tube after
intubation. CXR [**6-25**] showed increased prominence of the airspace
consolidations at both bases, consistent with pneumonia. He was
treated with Vancomycin/Cefepime. Repeat CXR on [**7-10**] showed
marked improvement compared to 10 days prior with small residual
right lower lobe consolidation

6. Hyponatremia: Sodium nadired at 128, but was 130 at the time
of discharge. He has a history of hyponatremia secondary to
Trileptal use. Nutrition changed his tube feeds to Probalance to
decrease the amount of free water he was taking in.

7. Thrombocytosis: His platelets peaked at 1255, and were 974 at
the time of discharge. This was thought to be a reactive
thrombocytosis secondary to an underlying process, and not a
primary bone marrow disorder.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY:
C. difficile colitis
SBO from adhesions
Ischemic bowel
GI bleed
Hyponatremia likely secondary to Trileptal
Reactive Thrombocytosis

SECONDARY:
[**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome
Mental retardation
s/p recent J-tube placement


Discharge Condition:
Stable, nonverbal, moving all extremities against gravity,
tracks eyes past midline, no obvious abdominal pain


Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the hospital with C. difficile colitis, and
this treated with antibiotics. You then had hematemesis and your
blood pressure became low, consistent with an upper GI bleed. GI
and surgery were consulted, and you were taken to the OR. You
had an exploratory laparotomy, and were found to have an SBO
secondary to adhesions and ischemic bowels s/p resection and
primary anastamosis. You were in the ICU under the care of the
surgeons during this part of your hospitalization. You were then
transferred back to the floor, and were under the care of the
neurologists. Your sodium remained low (130 at the time of
discharge) during this hospitalization which is likely secondary
to Trileptal use. Because of this, nutrition changed your tube
feeds to Probalance to decrease the amount of free water you
were receiving (and increase your kilocalories). Your platelet
count was elevated to the 1000s, which is likely a reactive
thrombocytosis. Speech and Swallow evaluated you, and
recommended you remain NPO with supplemental nutrition.

Your Flagyl course was completed while you were in the hospital,
so you no longer need to take this medication. You were started
on Metoprolol 62.5 mg PO three times a day, because your heart
rate was fast during the hospitalization. Your Keppra was
discontinued. Your Phenytoin was changed to 100 mg three times a
day. You were started on Ativan 1 mg PO q8 hr. IN ONE WEEK THIS
SHOULD BE TAPERED TO 1 MG PO Q12 HR. Any further titration will
be determined when he follows up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 856**] in
Neurology.

If you develop increased frequency of seizures, decreased
responsiveness, abdominal pain, increased frequency of diarrhea,
fevers/chills, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 850**], or return to the ED.

.
[**2164-11-23**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm with delayed R wave
progression which is non-specific. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2164-9-5**] there is no significant change.
.
[**2164-11-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits given leftward rotation. No radiographic
evidence of pneumonia is detected. Pulmonary vascularity appears
within normal limits. No effusion or pneumothorax. Arm in the
down position limits evaluation on the lateral
radiograph. IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia
given limitations.
.
[**2164-11-23**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with early
involutional changes. No acute fractures are identified. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
[**2164-11-23**] PORTABLE ABD X-RAY: FINDINGS: Single frontal radiograph
of the abdomen shows a non-obstructive nondilated bowel gas
pattern. There is no free gas or pneumatosis. A mild amount of
retained fecal material is present. Visualized osseous
structures are unremarkable and there are no soft tissue
calcifications. IMPRESSION: 1. No radiographic evidence of toxic
megacolon.
.
[**2164-11-26**] RIGHT ANKLE X-RAY: FINDINGS: Four views of the right
ankle are submitted. Screw tracts are present in the distal
fibula and there is residual osseous deformity from prior
fracture. The fracture is healed. The talus is abnormally
rotated with respect to the calcaneus and there is a medial
talar tilt. There is abnormal varus angulation of the foot. No
osseous findings to suggest osteomyelitis at this time.
.
[**2164-11-30**] ABD X-RAY: FINDINGS: Two frontal and two lateral
decubitus radiographs of the abdomen are interpreted in
comparison with radiograph from [**2164-11-23**]. Images show
an air-filled colon with associated minimal dilatation. Note is
made of a paucity of bowel gas in the area of the rectum.
Decubitus view show scattered air-fluid levels within the colon.
The small bowel shows scattered air-filled loops with no
dilatation. There is no free air and there is no pneumatosis.
Tiny pelvic phlebolith is seen as well as a 10 x 7 mm ovoid
calcific density in the deep pelvis which is unchanged when
compared to CT studies from [**2164-5-13**]. Visualized osseous
structures are notable for a mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.
IMPRESSION: Air-filled loop of colon with minimal dilatation,
though a paucity of gas is seen in the rectum and distal sigmoid
overall concerning for possible obstruction in the appropriate
clinical setting.
.
[**2164-11-30**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST:
- CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are left greater
than right bibasilar opacities, likely representing atelectasis,
left basal opacity is slightly more concerning for aspiration.
There is thickening of the distal esophagus. The liver, spleen,
adrenal glands, pancreas are unremarkable. Kidneys enhance
equally and excrete contrast normally. There is no free air, no
free fluid, no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal loops of small bowel are
not dilated. The contrast passes through the small bowel into
the colon, reaching distal transverse colon. There is fecal
material and gas noted throughout the descending colon as well
as gas present in the rectum. Normal appendix is seen. The cecum
is very large and displaces the sigmoid colon.
- CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon
are unremarkable. Urinary bladder wall demonstrates concentric
thickening, which may be due to underdistension, chronic UTI can
have this appearance. There is no pelvic fluid and no
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
Bilateral inguinal nodes measure up to 9 mm in short axis
diameter. The prostate is enlarged up to 5 cm in transverse
dimension.
- BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic
lesions. Anterior compression deformity of T12 vertebral body is
stable.
- IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of small bowel obstruction or stool impaction.
Distended cecum with mass effect on the sigmoid, intermittent
obstruction may be result.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis, left lower lobe opacity is concerning
for aspiration if the patient is at risk.
3. Concentric urinary bladder wall thickening, greater in extent
compared to the prior study. Cystitis can also have this
appearance; outlet obstruction less likely given more normal
appearance on [**2164-6-12**] studies.

[**2164-12-3**] ENDOSCOPY:Erythema and congestion and superficial
erosion in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with mild
esophagitis
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus (biopsy) Erythema and
congestion in the stomach body and antrum compatible with mild
gastritis (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the first part of the
duodenum, second part of the duodenum and third part of the
duodenum (biopsy) Small hiatal hernia

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old man with a history of presumed [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut
Syndrome and epilepsy presents with a in the setting of fever.
.
# Seizures: Patient has a well-known seizures history due to
[**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut, although his [**Location (un) 850**] believes his
presentation may have been due to an episode of rigors in the
setting of fever and leukocytosis. Corrected phenytoin level was
9.1 on admission, and he received additional phenytoin 300 mg IV
x 1. CT head negative. Infectious work-up remarkable only for
UTI, for which pt completed a 7-day course of
amoxicillin/ampicillin. He was switched back to outpatient oral
phenytoin dose but continued to have seizures lasting up to half
a minute, which was determined by neurology to be consistent
with baseline seizures. Rechecked corrected phenytoin level was
5, and pt given additional bolus of phenytoin 150 mg IV and then
started on increased dose of phenytoin 150 mg po bid. Phenytoin
and albumin levels should be followed to ensure therapeutic
level of [**9-26**]; level was 7.2 on day of discharge, neurology
called, recommended rechecking level in [**12-14**] weeks with albumin.
.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Per [**Date Range 850**], patient with fevers on
and off for months so fever work-up initiated. Lactate nl, RF
slightly elevated. CXR negative. Vancomycin discontinued as LP
without evidence. Ceftriaxone stopped and continued on
ampicillin/amoxicillin (dependent on NPO status) for UTI, which
grew out VRE. As patient initially still spiking fevers with
markedly elevated CRP, R foot x-ray done to rule out R ankle
osteomyelitis given history of this. Patient subsequently
defervesced and leukocytosis resolved. Of note, CT abd/pelvis
showed left greater than right bibasilar opacities, likely
representing atelectasis, but left basal opacity slightly more
concerning for aspiration. Unable to correlate with exam as
limited by cooperation but as pt remained afebrile off
antibiotics and as evaluated on this admission by Speech/Swallow
with no signs of aspiration, did not pursue further work-up.
Would recommend repeat CXR if pt does spike a new fever.
.
# Enterococcus UTI: As above, completed 7-day course of
antibiotics.
.
# ?Aspiration pneumonia: Reevaluated by Speech/Swallow on this
admission with no evidence of aspiration with thin liquids.
Recommended to continue ground diet, thin liquids, and whole
pills mixed with food. Questionable left-sided aspiration
pneumonia on CT abd/pelvis as above; would repeat CXR if pt
spikes new fever.
.
# R/o Barrett's esophagus: Pt scheduled for outpatient endoscopy
to evaluate this but done as inpatient. Of note, CT abd/pelvis
showed thickening of the distal
esophagus. Pt underwent endoscopy on [**2164-12-3**] which showed
concern for Barrett's esophagus.  Biopsies will need to be
followed up.
.
# Anemia: Hct remained stable but given h/o iron deficiency
anemia also seen on labs on this admission, pt repleted with IV
iron and discharged with oral iron supplements. Attempt made to
perform colonoscopy as inpatient given this and as pt nearing
routine screening age but was hampered by inadequate bowel prep
despite prolonged efforts involving multiple bottles of mag
citrate and tap water enemas. Would still recommend pursuing in
the long run given persistent iron deficiency anemia and
possibility of detecting colon cancer at an early stage.
.
# Constipation: Pt inadequately bowel prepped for colonoscopy
likely secondary to high rectal stool impaction out of reach
manually. However, abdomen soft with no evidence of obstruction
on CT abd/pelvis. Would recommend maintaining a good, regular
bowel regimen daily as outpatient to prevent stool impaction,
especially in anticipation of need for outpatient colonoscopy in
the future.
.
# Enlarged prostate: Per CT abdomen/pelvis, the prostate is
enlarged up to 5 cm in transverse dimension. Pt able to void
bladder. Would follow up as outpatient.
.
# Transaminitis: Mild elevation which subsequently resolved.
Abdominal exam benign. [**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to med effect v.
viral infection. Viral hepatitis panel negative.
.
# Peripheral neuropathy: Thought to be secondary to dilantin.
Continued on outpatient Vitamin B12
.
# Mental Retardation: Mental status at baseline as per attendant
from group home.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 y/o M with a history of [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome who is
nonverbal at baseline who presents with fever and associated
vomiting for 1 day and a leukocytosis, with exam, oxygen
requirement, and imaging consistent with health-care associated
pneumonia.

1. Pneumonia: Patient presented with fever to 101 and
leukocytosis with a CXR consistent with left base consolidation
and a new supplemental O2 requirement. Was found to be
hypotensive in the ED, although volume responsive and was
normotensive on arrival to the MICU. Although a nursing home
resident, he was initially covered in the ED with vanco,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and he defervesced overnight and
so was continued on this regimen at the time of transfer to the
regular floors. Blood cultures drawn in the ED prior to
antibiotics were negative. On the floor, pt had fever to 100.8
and was broadened to vancomcyin, zosyn and azithromycin. He lost
IV access and was briefly transitioned to PO regimen with
linezolid, flagyl, and levofloxacin.  He did well for >36 hours
with no fever or leukocytosis on this oral regimen so decision
was made to contiune treatment on oral antibiotics to be
completed at home.  Repeat CXR in [**2-13**] weeks recommended to
ensure complete resolution.

2.  [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome: At best pt has [**4-17**] sz/wk and can
often have daily seizures. Was continued on home anti-epileptic
regimen including phenytoin, keppra, and felbatol. Dilantin
levels were measured and were therapeutic. Pt did not have any
seizures during hospitalization.

3. Anemia: baseline of 30-33. Hct at baseline during admission.
He has a history of chronic GI bleeds, had several guaiac
positive stools during admission, however Hct stable throughout
hospitalization. On ferrous sulfate TID usually, but was changed
to daily considering h/o constipation.

4. Dysphagia: Continued a ground diet with thickened liquids and
pills crushed in ice cream or applesauce, at the time of
discharge he was tolerating his diet well

5. Diarrhea: pt with several loose stools during admission, C
diff negative x 3.  Resolved at time of discharge.

6. Barrett's Esophagus: Continued [**Hospital1 **] PPI.

7. Osteoporosis: stable, continued his TUMS

8. Peripheral Neuropathy: remained stable, continued vitamin B12

9. Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during
admission.

10. Code: Full code

Issues on discharge:
Repeat CXR in [**2-13**] weeks recommended to ensure complete
resolution.

Chief Complaint:
bloody diarrhea x 2 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy x 2 (+1 failed [**12-23**] poor prep)
Tagged RBC GI bleeding study

History of Present Illness:
83yo woman with h/o diverticulosis, C. Diff who presents with
bloody diarrhea for 2 weeks. States is constipated at baseline
(1 BM qod), and has a h/o hemorrhoids so she initially thought
her bloody diarrhea was hemorrhoidal bleeding. Her BM frequency
increased to 2-3BM's day from baseline. The color was darker
than normal for her. The diarrhea was unusually malordorous. She
came to [**Hospital1 18**] because she just wasn't getting better and was fed
up with wearing sanitary pads. Also worried because her sister
passed away from colon CA last year (age 81). Denies any
abdominal pain or N/V. No CP, no SOB. She has been tolerating
POs normally but notes a slightly decreased appetite and weight
loss of 5 pounds. Feels tired and weak but denies dizziness or
lightheadedness. No recent hospitalizations but was hospitalized
last year in [**Month (only) **] for pneumonia, developed C. Diff which
required 3 months of treatment.
.
In the ER she was found to have a hct of 38 (baseline), she had
guaiac positive melena on exam. She received 1L NS. GI was
called and recommended CT abdomen with contrast, which was
negative for colitis, showed patent arteries, and showed
diverticulosis without diverticulitis. They recommended
colonoscopy in AM, and she was begun on GoLytely prep. However,
the patient did not tolerate this and was changed to Mag
Citrate. She also received 1 unit of PRBCs.
.
On admission to the fllor she feels well but weak. BMs are still
dark, mixed with blood.

Past Medical History:
PMHx:

GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2192-5-24**]
IMPRESSION: Bleeding from the distal sigmoid/rectum.
.
ECHO [**5-24**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a severe resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (peak gradient >150 mmHg)
in the setting of hyperdynamic state. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is systolic anterior motion
of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83yo woman with h/o diverticulosis, C.Diff, presented with
bloody diarrhea x 2 weeks. Infectious causes ruled out (neg
CDiff, campy, salm, shig), and CT negative for mesenteric
ischemia. Colonoscopy [**5-21**] found a bleeding sigmoid diverticulum
that was injected with epinephrine with good hemostasis. In
setting of GIB anemia and demand ischemia, pt suffered mild
NSTEMI. Pt began to pass bloody stools again, necessitating RBC
transfusions to maintain HCT. Tagged RBC study showed rebleed in
sigmoid colon not amenable to angio. GI re-scoped on [**5-25**], which
showed normal colon with no bleeding. Pt.'s HCT remained stable
until disharge and did not have further bleeding.
.
# GIB: Presented with 2 weeks of bleeding at home. Infectious
etiologies ruled out. Mesenteric ischemia ruled out by CT.
Diverticular bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but
patient with continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid
on tagged RBC study [**5-24**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to
angio intervention. She continued to be supported with aggresive
pRBC trasfusions until her repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] which
showed a no source of bleeding. She did not have any further
bloody BMs and was hemodyamically stable as of [**2192-5-29**].
.
# CHEST PAIN: Patient has had negative CKs but small troponin
leak, ? 1mm ST depressions on EKG from [**5-21**]. Likely represents
mild NSTEMI from demand ischemia, as tends to recur only when
patient drops her hematocrit to the mid 20's. Cardiology
consulted, agree that this represents demand ischemia, recommend
agressive transfusion. Echo obtained showed LVOF obstruction in
setting of hyperdynamic state, mild-moderate MR, but no wall
motion abnormalities. ASA was initally given but held per GI
recommendations. Patient was put on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] in the
setting of her NSTEMI. Pt. will follow up with cardiology as
outpatient [**2192-6-5**].
.
#SOB: after aggressive volume resuscitation and blood
transfusions, the patient began to experience SOB and tachypnea.
A CXR was c/w volume overload and CHF. She was treated with
Lasix 10mg x 2, which excellent diuretic effect and symptomatic
relief. Pt. was started on Lasix 20mg QD on discharge.
.
# HTN: We held her diuretic throughout her stay in the setting
of her GIB, and restarted B blocker during her admission
(metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]). Her home diltiazem was held.
.
# BRONCHIECTASIS: Continued on home meds of albuterol MDI prn,
spiriva qd. Added albuterol/atrovent nebulizers.
.
# PPX: Received PPI, avoided heparin throughout given her bleed,
used pneumoboots.
.
# FEN: Although often NPO for procedures, she ate a heart
healthy cardiac diet. IV NS as necessary.

[**2192-6-5**]: GI Bleeding Study
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained. A left lateral
view of the pelvis was also obtained at 90 minutes.
Blood flow images show no evidence of radiotracer extravasation.

Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of radiotracer
extravasation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of GI bleeding.

[**6-6**] Colonoscopy:
Findings:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the sigmoid colon,
descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen throughout the
colon.There was no active bleeding noted.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the colon
Normal mucosa in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse
colon and ascending colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to mid
ascending colon
Recommendations:
1. No active bleeding noted although pt could have bleed from
these diverticuli.
2. Follow serial Hct
3. If continues to bleed, need repeat bleeding scan/angio and
surgical consult.
Additional notes: 1. Procedure done with attending supervision.

[**2192-6-7**]: CXR INDICATION: Chest pain. Gastrointestinal bleed.
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Vascular
pedicle has decreased in width and pulmonary vascularity appears
less engorged, consistent with overall improvement in volume
status of the patient. There are hazy areas of poorly defined
opacity in both upper lungs, right greater than left.
Differential diagnosis includes asymmetric edema versus focal
aspiration or infection. Small pleural effusions are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. is an 83y/o F with a PMH of diverticulosis recently
discharged on [**2192-5-29**] s/p LGIB secondary to bleeding
diveriticulus admitted [**6-3**] with BRBPR.

# Diverticulosis - During prior hospitalization pt. was admitted
with a 2 week history of BRBPR at home. On [**5-21**] a diverticular
bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but patient with
continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid on tagged
RBC study [**5-24**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to angio
intervention. Repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] not able to identify
further source of bleeding. Pt discharged on [**5-29**] with a stable
hct. Since that time Pt. was doing well at home until she again
had an episode of BRBPR which she reported to fill the commode
the day prior to admission. She was admitted to MICU for further
evaluation. In MICU pt. was transfused 2U PRBCs. Surgery
consulted and felt no acute intervention was needed. GI
consulted, deferred colonoscopy at this time. UA positive and
pt. started on cipro. B-blocker initially held due to bleeding,
restarted [**6-4**] at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. She had no further epsiodes of
bleeding and was deemed stable for transfer to the floor. After
transfer pt. had one episode of BRBPR. GI bleeding study was
completed but no source of bleeding localized. IR consulted and
felt she was not amendable to angiography at this time. Pt. also
seen by surgery who felt no acute procedure was needed. Pt. was
found to have a HCT of 30.1 and she was transfused an additional
2U PRBC with appropriate increase in HCT. Pt. had repeat
colonoscopy on [**2192-6-6**] which demonstrated diverticulum but no
clear source of bleeding. She had no further of episodes of
bleeding during admission. Her diet was advanced to regular and
was tolerated well. She had a stable HCT through the remainder
of her hospital stay and was deemed stable for discharge home.
Pt. developed loose stools the day prior to admission. First C.
diff toxin negative. Pt. had not having large volume diarrhea.
Repeat C. diff toxin sent prior to discharge and pt. informed to
contact PCP to follow up results as outpatient.
.
# UTI - Pt. had a positive UA on presentation to the ED. Her
culture was mixed flora. She was treated with a three day course
of cipro. Pt. was also found to have hematuria which was likely
caused by trauma secondary to foley insertion. She was advised
to follow up for further evaluation with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] UA prior to
discharge was negative for blood.
.
# Chest Discomfort - Pt. has history of mild NSTEMI from demand
ischemia from previous hospitalization for GI bleed. Echo
obtained showed LVOF obstruction in
setting of hyperdynamic state, mild-moderate MR, but no wall ASA
avoided given GI
recommendations. Patient was initially held on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]
but was restarted at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-4**]. Pt. had occassional
complaints of vague chest discomfort with no changes on ECG. On
[**6-7**] pt. experience increased chest discomfort which was
relieved by 2SL NTG and 2mg morphine. She had no changes on ECG,
no changes on CXR and negative CEX2. She was found to be
tachycardic and her metoprolol was increased to previous home
dose of 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and then titrated up to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for improved
HR. Pt. will follow up with cardiology as outpatient [**2192-6-12**].
.
She had no further of episodes of bleeding with a stable HCT and
was deemed stable for discharge home. She will follow up with
cardiology and her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was advised to call her PCP or [**Hospital **]
clinic if she has a recurrence of BRBPR and to return to ED.

After discharge pt. was found to have C. Diff positive result.
The patient's PCP was notified of this result.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Normal regional LV
systolic function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. An eccentric,anterior
directed jet and a central jet are seen The effective
regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2 The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral
position with normal leaflet motion. No mitral regurgitation is
seen.
2. Left ventricular systolic function is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. [**Location (un) 109**] is still mildly decreased with no gradient (Peak of 12 mm
of Hg).
4. Other findings are unchanged

CHEST (PA & LAT) - [**2179-5-30**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
evidence
of mild bilateral hilar enlargement, potentially due to hilar
lymphadenopathy or enlarged pulmonary arteries.  Minimal
atelectasis at the left lung base and along the minor fissure.
No evidence of pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No pleural
effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 939**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2179-5-24**] and taken to the Operating Room for L2-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach.

# Lumbar spondylosis, scoliosis, and stenosis.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was
transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. TEDs/pneumoboots
were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous
antibiotics were given per standard protocol. Initial postop
pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the
operating room for a scheduled L2-S1 decompression with PSIF as
part of a staged 2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated
operative note for further details. The second surgery was also
without complication and the patient was transferred to the
T/SICU in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT was 25 and she
was given 2 units PRBCs.  She was maintained on strict supine
bedrest for 48 hours given the small dural tear that was noted.
She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was
advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain
medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#3
from the second procedure. She was fitted with a lumbar
warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted
for mobilization OOB to ambulate.

#) Delirium:
During her post-operative course, the patient was noted to be
confused and disoriented, prompting transfer to medicine for
further management of her delirium.  This was felt to be
possibly as secondary to narcotic medication and lingering
effects of anesthesia.  Infectious etiologies were ruled out and
the patient underwent an ABG which did not reveal evidence of
hypoventilation.  Her mental status improved significantly and
she was awake, alert, oriented x3 and long longer confused prior
to discharge.

#) Pain control:
The patient was intially maintained on a fentanyl PCA and this
was transitioned to oral pain medications with good control
prior to discharge.  She was followed by the chronic pain
service given her history of multiple medication allergies.  She
is to be discharged on tramadol, topiramate, and aceaminophen.

#) Anemia
Patient's baselined hematocrit was felt to be approximately 40
(from [**2179-4-24**]).  She required PRBC transfusions given
intraoperative blood [**Last Name (un) 940**].  Her hematocrit remained stable upon
discharge (28-29).

CHRONIC PROBLEMS

bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2195-2-5**] to the
cardiothoracic service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] with the initial
diagnosis of coronary artery disease, unstable angina,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, increased
cholesterol, AS, sleep apnea and obesity.  The patient had
coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 which included a left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal right coronary
artery and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal
diagonal sequential.  The patient also had an aortic valve
replacement, a 21 mm mosaic porcine valve.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's
postoperative stay was complicated and total in-hospital days
was over 100.

The patient's initial hospital course was uncomplicated
within the intensive care unit.  On [**2-7**] the patient had a
bronchoscopy in which mucous plugs were removed from the
right upper lobe.  In early [**Month (only) 404**] the patient had
difficulty swallowing with possible aspiration.  Speech and
swallow evaluated the patient and noted that the patient had
severe upper esophageal achalasia.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] saw the
patient and agreed the patient would need a dilatation of the
esophagus and placement of a feeding tube.

On [**2195-2-14**] the patient was brought to the operating room and
had a dilatation of the esophagus with [**Doctor Last Name 953**] dilators and
placement of a percutaneous feeding tube.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

On [**2195-2-19**] renal saw the patient for increased BUN and
creatinine.  They initially thought the patient was prerenal
or could possibly have ATN.  Their initial recommendations
were to repeat the urinalysis, cultures, electrolytes,
discontinue Lasix and discontinue non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs.  The patient was still intubated at
that time and it was also decided that the patient would
benefit from a tracheostomy.

On [**2195-2-20**] a tracheostomy tube was placed for respiratory
failure, inability to wean from a vent.  A percutaneous
tracheostomy tube placement of a #8 Shiley tube was done by
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 954**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 955**].  The surgery was uncomplicated
and the patient was transferred back to the CSRU in stable
condition.

On [**2195-2-21**] plastic surgery was asked to see the patient for
nonhealing saphenous vein graft donor sites where t.i.d.
dressing changes were then instituted and recommendations for
a V.A.C. to follow.

A her renal function did not return, the renal service
continued to follow closely and thought this could be a
mixture of acute tubular necrosis and prerenal disorder.  On
[**2195-2-16**] a right femoral vein dialysis catheter was placed
using the Seldinger technique for increased creatinine and
acute renal failure.

At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] the percutaneous tube subsequently
resulted in necrosis of the abdominal wall at the site of the
G-tube.  This was treated with nasogastric tube decompression
and tube feedings distal to the pylorus to allow the wound to
heal.  The gastrocutaneous fistula closed but the patient
developed extensive left leg cellulitis and induration.  The
patient was brought to the operating room on [**2195-3-17**] and had
a left abdominal wall and flank incision and drainage of the
deep soft tissue.  At that time the patient's chest also
showed signs of infection and drainage.  Initially wet-to-dry
dressings were started at the area and a V.A.C. dressing was
then placed to aid in healing.

Urology was also consulted at this time for hematuria which
responded to irrigation.  The hematuria resolved
spontaneously.  The renal failure continued throughout the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay with hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.

Infectious disease was consulted for Klebsiella in the sputum
and Gram-negative rods for which the patient was placed on
cefuroxime.  They also evaluated for the chest wall abdominal
wounds.

At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] also the patient had a cystoscopy to
evaluate for the hematuria.  At that time the urology team
recommended repeat alum irrigant x 2 days.

Over the course of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay the
gastrocutaneous fistula closed and the nasogastric tube was
subsequently clamped and then removed.  During the
hospitalization the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed
several times to equate with the bacteria in the wound,
sputum and urine.

EP was also consulted for arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation
for which the recommended medical treatment and
heparinization.

In [**Month (only) 956**] the patient continued to have issues with
infectious disease.  The patient had a sternal wound
dehiscence with a wound infection and gastrocutaneous
fistula, the lower right extremity wound infection and
Klebsiella pneumoniae which was causing septic symptoms.
During this time the patient was continued on Nepro tube
feeds for nutrition and antibiotics were used in relation to
bacteria growing in the cultures.  At that time the patient
was still MRSA negative.  There was sparse growth of
Klebsiella in the sputum and there was sparse growth of
Klebsiella in the fistula and sparse growth of B. fragilis
and beta lactamase positive in the right leg wound.

Over the hospital course the patient received multiple units
of packed red blood cells to normalize her hematocrit.

Urology concluded that the patient suffered from hemorrhagic
cystitis and on the 15th cleared the patient as doing well.
They decided that the patient was well enough urologically
that she would need no other treatment and that she could
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] after discharge.

During the hospital stay the patient had multiple central
lines placed for access.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] was consulted in mid
[**Month (only) 956**] for evaluation of nutrition and assistance with tube
feedings.

At the end of [**Month (only) 956**] the patient suffered from multiple
wound infections, failure to thrive and vent dependency.  The
patient also continued on hemodialysis for the acute renal
failure.  During [**Month (only) 958**] the patient continued to improve in a
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] fashion.  The patient's antibiotics were
slowly weaned off.  The patient continued on Nepro at 40 cc
an hour.

In the middle of [**Month (only) 958**] the patient was evaluated by GI for
intermittent bleeding.  The patient most likely had gastritis
or esophagitis per GI and they recommended endoscopic
evaluation.

Service:

This is an addendum to the discharge summary for the days
[**2-5**] to [**5-28**].

During the month of [**Month (only) 958**] the patient progressed with
physical therapy and treatments of her infections with
antibiotics and good nutrition.  At the end of [**Month (only) 958**] the
patient had a IJ Perm-A-Cath placed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
back to the CSRU in stable condition.  During this time the
patient was fed using a post pyloric tube while keeping the
nasogastric tube to suction to allow closure of
enterocutaneous fistula.  Toward the end of [**Month (only) 958**] the
nasogastric tube was removed.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] on the [**4-18**] placed a feeding jejunostomy tube.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported back to the
CSRU in stable condition.  Following surgery the patient was
restarted on the tube feeds Nepro 40 cc with 110 grams of
ProMod q.d.  The patient continued to progress during her
hospital stay and it was decided that the patient would be
able to be discharged to rehabilitation services for further
physical therapy.

On the [**4-26**] it was decided that the patient will be
able to be transferred to rehabilitation services.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female
patient who had a very prolonged previous hospitalization at
the [**Hospital1 69**] and was ultimately
discharged on [**2195-5-28**].  During her hospitalization,
she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with an aortic
valve replacement.  Her postoperative course was complicated
by aspiration, wound infection of her sternal wound as well
as of her saphenectomy, gastrostomy tube placement, followed
by necrosis of the abdominal wall as well as acute renal
failure.  Please see discharge summary from that
hospitalization for details of her postoperative course after
her cardiac surgery.

The patient was readmitted to the hospital on [**2195-6-6**]
due to fevers to 103 at the rehabilitation facility despite
being on intravenous antibiotics.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient was noted to have a fair amount of
purulent drainage in the open sternal wound.  The patient was
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft as previously noted with an aortic valve replacement
for aortic stenosis.

HEENT was unremarkable.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Patient was tachycardic with a regular, rate,
and rhythm.  Her abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, and
nondistended.

LABORATORY VALUES UPON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  White
blood cell count of 10,000, hematocrit of 32, platelet count
of 201.  Sodium of 148, potassium 3.3, chloride 110, CO2 21,
BUN 42, creatinine 3.7, glucose of 277.

Patient initially had an echocardiogram which revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60% and moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

Chest x-ray on admission to the hospital revealed a small
left pleural effusion, and questionable congestive heart
failure pattern.

It was noted that the patient's Vancomycin and tobramycin
levels were quite low upon admission to the hospital, and she
was restarted on both of those medications.

On [**6-7**], hospital day two, the patient underwent a
Plastic Surgery consultation due to persistent sternal wound
infection, which had previously been healing now showing
signs of infection.  Patient was also noted to have
Clostridium difficile colitis, for which she had been placed
on intravenous Flagyl.

The patient was ultimately taken to the operating room on
[**2195-6-9**] after transesophageal echocardiogram the
previous day ruled out endocarditis.  In the operating room
the patient underwent a limited sternal wound debridement and
drainage of some fluids at the inferior portion of her wound.

Postoperatively, the patient returned to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit, where she has had problems with
intermittent hypotension requiring IV Neo-Synephrine drip.
Patient continued on tube feeds via her jejunostomy tube
which was previously placed during her previous admission,
which she had been tolerating well.  She was still on the
ventilator on varying levels of pressure support in the CPAP
mode which she had tolerated well on 50% FIO2.

Patient received a few units of packed red blood cells over
the course of the next few days due to drifting hematocrit.
Patient's sternal wound had remained clean, and ultimately a
VAC dressing was placed in the sternal wound area on [**2195-6-18**].  The patient was maintained on 3x a week hemodialysis
treatments on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and has been
tolerating those treatments well.  Patient's pressure support
was ultimately weaned from 12 to 5, and she has remained on
pressure support of 5 for the past few days with an FIO2 of
50% and a PEEP of 5 as well, and has remained stable on those
ventilator settings.

The patient has had short bouts of trache mask trials, but
does get tachypneic after approximately 30 minutes.  Patient
also required bedside repositioning of her jejunostomy tube
which was done in the Intensive Care Unit successful with no
sequelae from that patient.  The patient has remained with
stable hemodynamic parameters.  Has been tolerating her tube
feeds, has remained on minimal ventilator supports, and she
is ready to be transferred to rehabilitation facility to
progress with Physical [**Hospital 966**] rehabilitation, and ultimate
weaning from a ventilator.

The patient's condition day on [**2195-6-19**] is as follows:
temperature is 99.0, heart rate is 88 in normal sinus rhythm,
respiratory rate varies from 18-24.  Her blood pressure is
114/46.  On the ventilator, the patient is in a CPAP mode
with 5 of PEEP, 5 of pressure support, and 50% of O2 with a
most recent blood gas being 7.41, 41, 73, 27.  Other
laboratory values from today, [**6-19**] are as follows:  White
blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit of 35.8, platelet count of
206.  PT 13.9, INR 1.3, PTT 29.9, sodium 132, potassium 5.3,
chloride 99, CO2 24, BUN 64, creatinine 3.6, glucose 124.

Patient's most recent chest x-ray was on [**2195-6-8**] which
showed a chronic left pleural effusion.

Most recent cultures include a sputum culture from [**6-8**]
which revealed MRSA, Pseudomonas, as well as Serratia.
Patient is previously cultured MRSA from both her leg wound
and her sternal wound.  Stool on [**6-10**] is positive for
Clostridium difficile.  Urine on [**6-12**] is positive for
proteus and enterococcus, and her sternal wound swab on [**6-9**] had rare growth of diphtheroids.

Physical examination today:  The patient is awake, alert, and
responsive.  She has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Her
chest wound is clean with a VAC dressing in place.  Her
abdomen is soft, obese, and nontender.  Her extremities are
with 2+ edema bilaterally.

sinus, likely secondary to hypoxia, hyperkalemia.

1) CARDIAC - Status post arrest.  Patient with history of
arrest.  The patient was ruled out by enzymes.  The arrest
was likely a combination of hypoxia and mucous plugging, as
well as metabolic with possible hyperkalemia and
hypercalcemia.  The patient has a history of a normal echo.
The patient's rhythm was in sinus.  The patient was continued
on 200 mg po qd.  The patient placed on telemetry and
monitored in the MICU.  Monitored electrolytes and in's and
out's.  The patient remained stable throughout her

Date of Birth:   [**2120-5-13**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old
female with an extremely complicated past medical history
including coronary artery bypass graft times four, atrial
ventricular valve replacement in [**1-12**], and a precipitously
difficult postoperative course.  The patient has never been
weaned from her ventilator and has had multiple ventilator
associated pneumonias, particularly most recently with
pseudomonas Serratia and Klebsiella.  The patient has end
stage renal disease and history of gastrointestinal bleed
secondary to gastritis and esophagitis.

Most recently, the patient was discharged from this hospital
to rehabilitation in early [**Month (only) 547**] only to come back with
fevers and ultimately grew out Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus wound infection requiring debridement
on [**2195-5-28**].  The patient returned to rehabilitation
[**2195-6-22**], where she sustained a pulmonary embolus arrest,
received Epinephrine and electrical conversion.  The patient
was noted to have decreased responsiveness post code
attributed to anoxic brain injury per neurology.  She was
transferred back to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation where she
underwent vigorous physical therapy.

On [**2195-8-1**], per family she had a fever of 103 with culture
peripherally and from her dialysis catheter.  Both grew out
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was
started on a course of Vancomycin with only low grade
temperature.  She became lethargic on [**2195-8-9**], and was
unable to tolerate hemodialysis due to hypotension, systolic
blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient briefly improved
postdialysis on [**2195-8-10**], as did her mental status, but then
became increasingly lethargic with heart beats in the 130s,
blood pressure 80 over palpable, and was transferred over to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.

On arrival, the patient was noted to be extremely febrile,
hypotensive, tachypneic.  The patient received an A line and
right internal jugular central line for monitoring and fluid
resuscitation.  The patient's course was complicated by her
poor toleration of hemodialysis secondary to hypotension and
was started on pressors of Levophed and ultimately required
an addition of vasopressor.  The patient was becoming
increasingly somnolent and had not defervesced at this time
despite the addition of multiple antibiotic therapy, Flagyl,
Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Tobramycin.

CT of the abdomen and chest showed no frank abscess or fluid
collection.  Flagyl was ultimately discontinued as decreased
probability of anaerobic infection.  Cultures at outside
hospital showed multidrug resistant organisms including
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Transesophageal
echocardiogram was obtained to rule out endocarditis and it
was negative showing ejection fraction of 55%.  Left Hickman
catheter with [**Hospital1 **] as probable source of infection.
Foley was placed at this time.  The patient was anuric yet
10cc of purulent material was noted.  The patient was now
growing gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters from two
different sites, the Hickman and/or previous PICC line.  She
was increasing her pressor requirement and was hypotensive
despite two liters of fluid.

She was started on Dopamine in addition to her Levophed and
vasopressors. Throughout the day, the patient's systolic
blood pressure decreased to the 80/30.  By [**2195-8-14**], she was
back on EC vent control.  The patient was noted at 3:43 a.m.
on [**2195-8-15**], to have an episode of asystole.  The family was
at bedside as well throughout the night.  The pupils were
noted to be fixed and dilated and unresponsive.  Ventilation
was discontinued and spontaneous respirations were not
observed.  The patient was declared dead at 3:43 a.m. The
family declined autopsy.

Brief Hospital Course:
After initial presentation to the ED, patient was admitted to
the surgical intensive care unit under the direct care of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. In the ED, patient became hypotensive requiring liters
of IVF, oxygen 4LNC administered, started on Levophed 0.1 mg,
central line was place, Levofloxacin and Flagyl intravenously
were started for leukocytosis. Blood, urine and stool cultures/c
Diff sent. CT scan was obtained and revealed; severe colonic
wall thickening involving ascending, transverse, and descending
colon, less pronounced sigmoid and rectum. The pancolitis
picture was suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis.
.
ICU Course HD2-HD4: HD2, patient remained on Levophed and
insulin drips, receiving fluid resuscitation with lactated
ringers, leukocytosis increasing from 12 to 25, bandemia,
antibiotic coverage was levofloxacin and Flagyl. Abdomen was
more distended, no tenderness, adequate urine output and organ
perfusion, KUB revealed edematous colon but no dilation,
multiple episodes of liquid green stool, specimen for C. Diff
was positive. HD3, WBC trending down, Levophed slowly weaned
off, abdomen less distended, minimally tender in lower
quadrants. HD4, chest x-ray revealed fluid overload with mild
increase in the cardiac silhouette and bilateral pleural
effusions. Patient received Lasix 10mg IV with good effect.
Levoflaxacin was d/c and vancomycin po was started. Patient was
hemodynamically stable and transferred to CC6 (floor).
.
HD5, patient was an episode of dropping oxygen saturation 84-88%
on 4Liters nasal cannula, lungs sounds positive for crackles at
the bases, patient received Lasix 20mg IV once with good effect.
WBC continued to trend down. She received substantial
electrolyte repletion of potassium, magnesium and neutrophos.
Patient started on a clear diabetic liquid diet and advanced to
regular diet. She was started on home dose of Lantus. Patient
continued to have multiple diarrhea stools. Central line was
d/c. Foley catheter was d/c and patient was voiding without
difficulty. Infectious disease, [**Hospital **] clinic and Physical
Therapy were consulted.
.
Infectious Disease was consulted on HD#5; patient presenting
with C. Diff infection in the absence of antibiotic use,
exposure or known contact at health care facility, and no recent
invasive procedures. Patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 976**] (Fellow)
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 977**] (Attending), assessed that since patient
has a history of an autoimmune disorder, may not be completely
"normal" host. The differential for pancolitis would also
include CMV colitis, ischemic colitis (less likely). They
recommended obtaining a CMV viral load, repeat iron studies
given microcytic anemia, plan to check C. Diff toxin prior to
starting vancomycin taper. continue with Vancomycin by mouth 250
mg every 6 hours times 14 days, then 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days, then
250 mg daily x 7 days, then off. They also instructed patient on
hygiene techniques for her home.
.
Physical therapy consult concluded that patient may require
rehabiliation upon discharge if mobility does not improve.
Patient remains functioning below baseline level and
deconditioned from hospitalization. It was recommended that
patient would benefit from increase mobility and breathing
exercises.
.
[**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted on HD7 for management of IDDM.
Patient is known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] @ [**Hospital **] Clinic. They
recommended to increase Lantus to 12 units daily, increase
pre-meal sliding-scale, switch from regular insulin to humalog,
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] after discharge.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82 year old male with past medical history of coronary artery
disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, BPH, chronic
kidney disease and gout who presents with intermittent confusion
and high fevers. The patient is [**First Name3 (LF) 595**] speaking only, generally
sleepy but family (son) recounts that the patient had difficulty
voiding 6/1-2/[**2150**]. At the time, he endorsed urinating
frequently but small amounts each time (?frequency, urgency)He
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] and was found on urinalysis to have a
UTI. He did not have any fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, flank
pain at the time. He was discharged on Macrobid 100mg twice
daily X 7 days. The patient has been taking the medication
reliably but urine culture sensitivities/speciation today
demonstrated Enterobacter aerogenes sensitive to a number of
antibiotics, but resistant to macrobid. The patient's wife was
[**Name (NI) 653**] by the [**Name (NI) **] QA via [**Name (NI) 595**] interpreter and Cipro 250mg
tablets daily X 7 days was prescribed.
.
In the interim, the patient's son has been calling to check in
on him and found him progressively lethargic, dizzy and
intermittently unable to urinate. Today he slept throughout the
day and had some urinary frequency/urgency in the morning that
resolved this afternoon. He also developed high fevers
(temperature not taken) with rigors/shakes. He was noted to have
elevated blood sugars and lower blood pressures than normal. He
usually runs SBP160-180s, per his son, without antihypertensives
and SBP110-120s with them. This morning, he took all his
medications and subsequently, his blood pressures have been in
the SBP90s. The patient has taken in very little PO food/liquids
since [**2151-5-21**]. He did take one tablet of the Cipro this
afternoon and stated he felt somewhat better.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T100.8, HR96, BP111/46, RR20, O2 sat 97%
on RA. He was given acetaminophen 650mg PR and ciprofloacin
400mg IV X1. His labs were notable for hyponatremia (132), Cr
1.4 (close to prior baseline), leukocytosis to 11.9 with left
shift (no bands). His lactate was 1.6. He was also given IVF and
did become less lethargic, more interactive with family. He did
not urinate down in the ED to provide a repeat sample.
.
Upon transfer to the medical floor, vitals were T: 98.1 P: 88
BP: 103/45 RR: 25 SaO2: 95% on 2L NC (does not use oxygen at
home).

IMAGING:
[**2151-5-25**] NCHCT:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction.  The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is well preserved. There is
mild age-related brain parenchymal atrophy with secondary mild
dilatation of the ventricles.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoids are clear.  There are no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormality.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is significantly
disproportionate
lateral more than 3rd ventriculomegaly, compared to the degree
of sulcal
prominence; while this may simply represent preferential central
atrophy,
underlying communicating hydrocephalus is an additional
consideration, and
should be correlated clinically.
[**2151-5-25**] CXR:  There is a right infrahilar and a right lung apex
opacity, possibly representing multifocal PNA. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no
pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
[**2151-5-25**] EKG:  Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation. Right
bundle-branch block. Consider inferior myocardial infarction.
Since the previous tracing
of [**2145-5-31**], atrial fibrillation is new, axis is now more
leftward, and
QRS width is wider. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
90 0 172 410/462 0 -86 23
[**2151-5-26**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has unchanged focal parenchymal opacities in the right upper and
right lower lobe.  In addition, however, there is an increase in
size of the cardiac silhouette, increase in diameter of the
pulmonary vessels and increase of the interstitial markings.
Altogether, these findings suggest interval appearance of
pulmonary edema.
[**2151-5-26**] EKG:   Atrial fibrillation with a modestly controlled
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch
block with left anterior fascicular block.  There are tiny R
waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible myocardial
infarction. Compared to tracing #1 atrial fibrillation has
replaced by atrial tachycardia.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
91 0 152 368/422 0 -77 56
[**2151-5-27**] CXR:  Right upper lobe consolidation is more conspicuous
than before.  Right perihilar and lower lobe opacities have
improved.  Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.
Right pleural effusion is stable.  There is improved pulmonary
edema. There are no new lung abnormalities.
[**2151-5-28**] ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No vegetations seen
[**2151-5-29**] EKG:  Sinus rhythm. Prolonged P-R interval. Right
bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-5-27**], the rhythm has
changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  89 yo w/ afib, LBBB and recurrent UTIs admitted with
urospesis requiring MICU transfer, discharged home with a 2 week
course of ciprofloxacin and home physical therapy.
.
ENTEROBACTER BACTERMIA AND SEPSIS:  Patient initially was seen
in the emergency department approximatley 1 week prior to
admission with a UTI, treated with macrobid.  The patient was
subsquently [**Telephone/Fax (3) 653**] by the Emergency Department after culture
results returned with a macrobid resistant enterobacter species
and perscribed ciprofloxacin.  Approximately 2 days after
starting ciprofloxacin, though it is unclear how many doses the
patient took, he developed lethargy, confusion and fevers at
home.  He was admitted to the medical service where he quickly
triggered for hypotension and was not responsive to 4 L of fluid
boluses.  He was broadened to Vanc/Cefepime and subsequently
developed pulmonary edema in the setting of volume reusitation
and was transfered to the MICU without requiring intubation.
Blood cultures returned GNRs in [**3-24**] bottles later speciated as a
pan-sensitive enterobacter similar to what was seen in the
urine.  CXR showed a possible multifocal pneumonia as well.
Infectious diseases was consulted and recommended treatment with
ciprofloxacin for a 2 week course despite the patient's
prolonged QTc from a prior intrafasicular block.  No inpatient
urologic evaluation was felt indciated though his recurrent
urinary tract infections and prior prostate operations did
warrant further outpatient evaluation.  QTc at discharge was 444
ms.
.
# TROPONINEMIA:  Patient was noted to have an elevated troponin
with a normal CK-MB fraction in the setting of septic shock and
volume resusitation.  Given his coronary history and underlying
LBBB perventing adequate evaluation of ischemic changes the
patient underwent ECHO which showed a posterior/inferior
hypokenesis.  Cardiololgy was consulted and felt this be related
to demand and not an acute coronary process.  Patient was
continued on home meds and scheduled for outpatient cardiology
follow up.
.
# HTN: Patient's antihypertensives were initially held in the
setting of sepsis.  His antihypertensives were gradually
restarted but the patient was symptomatically hypotensive on his
home regimen while working with phsyical therapy.  His
amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide were therefore held and
patient was able to maintain pressures in the 120s on valsartan
320 mg, lasix 40 and metoprolol XL 50 mg daily.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Stable continued on home statin.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Stable, was intermittently in sinus
rhythm through out his stay.  Discharged on home metoprolol and
pradaxa.
.
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Stable, home oral hypoglycemics
were held in house in the setting of sepsis and patient
maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
.
# Benigm prostatic hypertrophy: s/p TURP and generally stable
though difficulty voiding and prior prostate instrumentation
raises the risk for recurrent UTIs.  Patient was scheduled for
outpatient urology follow up with his primary urologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 986**].
.
# Gout: Stable, no signs or symptoms of a flare continued home
allopurinol

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 65-year-old man
recently evaluated for worsening dyspnea on exertion.  The
patient was first evaluated for dyspnea on exertion back in
[**2183-9-28**].  At that point, he was found to have mild
left coronary artery disease as well as a totally occluded
right coronary artery with good collaterals.  He was also
noted to have a moderate mitral regurgitation.  He was
managed medically for this condition.

During the course of the year [**2184**], the patient noted
progressive decrease in his activity tolerance.  After work
up, it was determined that the patient was in need of repair
of his mitral valve as well as coronary artery bypass
grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Depression.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hyperlipidemia.
7.  Valve disease.
8.  Remote pleurisy.
9.  Arthritis.
10. Possible prior CVA.
11. Recovered alcoholic (has not drank in 16 years).

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Umbilical hernia repair.
2.  Cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Vistaril.
2.  Lipitor.
3.  Multivitamins.
4.  Aspirin.
5.  Escitalopram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Medical Center
on [**2185-10-25**] and taken to surgery for coronary artery bypass
graft and mitral valve repair.  Surgery was performed without
complications and patient thereafter was transferred to the
CSRU.  Later on the day of surgery, the patient received two
units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 21.2.

Patient required pacing through postoperative day #1 and #2
to maintain an adequate heart rate.  He was successfully
extubated on postoperative day #1, even though he continued
to be wheezy with significant productive cough during his
entire stay in the CSRU.

The patient as stable enough for transfer to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Floor late on postoperative day #2.
Late on postoperative day #5, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation.  His heart rate was eventually successfully
controlled with Metoprolol and Amiodarone.  The patient had
periods of persistent tachycardia during postoperative day
#6.  Decision was made to initiate anticoagulation with
heparin as well as Coumadin.  The patient remained stable and
without complaints during postoperative day #7.

On postoperative day #8, the patient was deemed stable for
discharge to home.  The decision was made to discontinue the
patient's Amiodarone prior to discharge given decrease in his
heart rate to the 50s.  He remained in sinus rhythm.

Following discharge, it was planned the patient would receive
a visit from a visiting nurse two days following discharge
for an INR check.  The results of the INR check was to be
faxed to the patient's cardiologist.  The patient was to call
his cardiologist on discharge day #2 for instructions on
further Coumadin doses.  The patient was to take 10 more days
of Lasix following discharge since he was still significantly
above his admission weight.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Escitalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atorvastatin 200 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Percocet.
5.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Potassium Chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. times two days.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) 996**]P:
1.  Patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in clinic
four weeks following discharge.
2.  Patient was to contact his cardiologist's office two days
following discharge for further guidance on his Coumadin
dosing as well as to schedule a follow up appointment.
3.  The patient was to contact his primary care physician's
office for a follow up appointment in approximately three
weeks.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG placement

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 59 year-old right-handed with progressively
worsening stiffness, weakness, and dysarthria since [**2183**] who is
sent in from her rehab for generalized weakness , decline and
difficulty eating. The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**] in the
movement disorders division who notes an extensive negative
workup in his most recent assessment of [**2186-1-10**] (see below).
Per
the record the stiffness started after a fall on ICE in [**2183**].
She
was admitted 7/21-26/07 for left leg dystonia. Possible
etiologies considered at that time included hereditary spastic
paraparesis, Parkinsons, and multiple systems atrophy. Little
evidence could be found for any of these disorders.


An new EMG today demonstrated a generalized, moderately severe,
chronic and ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons.


The patient has been on tizanidine, flexeril, baclofen, sinemet,
and artane - none with particularly significant effect.



Past Medical History:
depression,
rotator cuff injury,
osteopenia,
colectomy,
appendectomy
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1033**] [**2186-1-10**] note:
"Extensive prior evaluations were summarized in my note from [**6-11**], [**2185**], including multiple brain and spine imaging studies
that
have failed to yield an explanation for her symptoms. She also
was admitted. She has had negative HTLV 1 and 2 testing,
negatively glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, negative
spinal fluid analyses including absence of oligoclonal bands,
normal ceruloplasmin, negative RPR, negative Lyme serology,
negative [**Doctor First Name **], rheumatoid factor, and HIV test. EMG also was
reported to be normal in 08/[**2185**]. She was admitted in [**2185-7-24**]

with increased mobility difficulties. The additional evaluation

did not reveal a clear etiology. They initiated a trial of
tizanidine, and this may have helped somewhat. They also reduced

her Flexeril dose."


Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1034**] currently is living at the [**Hospital 745**] Healthcare
Center nursing home.


Family History:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1034**] is a 59-year-old woman who was admitted for
further evaluation of her chronic progressive movement disorder.
Based on her exam, which with her progression by the time of
this admission showed mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs,
and based on her EMG on the day of admission showing motor
neuron disease, she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS).

1. ALS. She was set up to follow up in the [**Hospital **] clinic. After a
pulmonology consult, it was seen that she did well with her
respiratory status when sitting upright during the day, but has
paradoxical breathing at night. She was transferred for one
night to the ICU for BiPAP titration, and she should now use
this at night.

2. Dysphagia. She passed a swallow eval, but was given a PEG for
supplemental nutrition and with the expectation that her
dysphagia will progress. She can take some nutrition by mouth
and is getting tube feeds as in the discharge instructions.
*** The T-fastener skin sutures (green-colored sutures) can be
cut and released in [**8-3**] days (between [**2-25**] and [**2-28**]). ***

3. Spasticity. She was started on tizanidine (Zanaflex) and
Flexeril for painful spasticity, and was given a Lidoderm patch
for the pain. This did improve her, though she remains highly
spastic.

4. Anxiety. Psychiatry was consulted for her anxiety and
recommended Ativan as ordered (with caution for her respiratory
status) and Buspar, in addition to continuing her Lexapro.

5. CODE STATUS: After length discussions with her, she decided
to be a DNR/DNI.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old male
referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for evaluation of surgical
options for severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery
disease.

The patient experienced a near-syncopal episode in [**2124-1-8**]; for which she was evaluated at [**Hospital 1048**] [**Hospital 1049**] Hospital.
As part of his workup, the patient received a cardiac
catheterization which subsequently demonstrated severe aortic
stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.78 cm2 and mild grade
[**12-11**] aortic insufficiency.  In addition, the patient
demonstrated 3-vessel disease of the right coronary artery,
left anterior descending artery, and circumflex with diffuse
68% stenosis of each.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was subsequently evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and
recommended for elective coronary artery bypass graft and
aortic valve repair to take place on [**2124-4-24**].

1.  Aspirin.
2.  Primidone.
3.  Vioxx.
4.  Tagamet.
5.  Terazosin.
6.  Lisinopril.
7.  Oxybutynin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired.  He is married and
lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1051**], [**Name (NI) 108**].  The patient has
a past history of smoking but has been abstinent for many
years.  The patient denies the use of alcohol or recreational
drugs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2124-4-24**] the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft using a saphenous vein graft and
aorta to the right posterior descending artery, as well as an
aortic valve repair using a 23-mm CE tissue valve.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well with a total bypass time
of 139 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 125 minutes.

The patient's pericardium was left open.  Lines placed
included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter.  Both
ventricular and atrial wires were placed.  Two mediastinal
tubes were placed.  The patient was subsequently transferred
intubated to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit for
further observation and management.

On transfer, the patient had a mean arterial pressure of 62,
a central venous pressure of 9, a PAD of 14, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1052**] of 19.
The patient was noted to be in a normal sinus rhythm at a
rate of 90 beats per minute.  Active drips on transfer
included propofol.

In the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was
initially noted to be agitated and hypertensive; requiring
treatment with a nitroglycerin drip and Haldol for sedation.

On postoperative day two, the patient was successfully weaned
and extubated without complications.  Following extubation,
the patient was noted to be confused with variable compliance
with following commands and variable orientation.  This
confusion continued for the duration of his admission with
gradual resolution to a level consistent with the patient's
baseline level of moderate dementia.

The patient continued to progress well clinically in the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit with an uneventful
transition to a full regular diet and adequate transition to
pain control via oral pain medications.

Following successful removal of his chest tubes and pacer
wires on postoperative day four, the patient was cleared for
transfer to the floor and was subsequently admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**].

On the floor, the patient continued to progress well
clinically to the time of his discharge.  The patient was
restarted on his home medications with a notable improvement
in his mental status and was also placed on evening
Risperidone 0.5 mg with a notable decrease in his nighttime
agitation.

On the evening of postoperative day six, the patient
sustained a minor fall while agitated; resulting in a small
abrasion to his right forearm without other associated
injuries.  At no time did the patient sustain any head trauma
or loss of consciousness.

On postoperative day seven, the patient's Foley catheter was
removed without complications.  He was subsequently noted to
be independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for
the duration of his stay.

The patient was also evaluated by Physical Therapy who
declared the patient a suitable candidate for placement in a
rehabilitation facility following resolution of his acute
medical issues.  Thereafter, the patient was screened by a
rehabilitation facility and subsequently cleared for
discharge to an extended care facility on postoperative day
nine ([**2124-5-3**]) with instructions for followup.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to an
extended care facility with instructions for followup.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 45 yo man with h/o HIV (CD4=227) and multiple past
pneumonias presents with acute LUL pneumococcal pneumonia ans
sepsis.

PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA AND SEPSIS
The patient presented with a cough productive of brown sputum,
pleuritic left sided chest pain, and a large left upper lobe
infiltrate on his CXR.  In the emergency department he became
tachypnic, hypoxic and hypotensive, with pressures that were not
responsive to fluid boluses.  He was intubated, started on
pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, and admitted to the
MICU.  His admission blood cultures showed high grade bacteremia
with pneumococcus (3/4 bottles positive).  He underwent a
broncheoalveolar lavage, from which cultures have remained
negative.  Once the blood culture data returned his coverage was
initially narrowed to levaquin, but he had persistent low grade
fevers and a worsening of his leukocytosis, so was again started
on broader coverage with cefepime and vancomycin for a question
of ventillator associated pneumonia.  He was successfully
extubated on [**2143-3-15**] and was transferred to the floor the
following day.

On the floor his coverage was again narrowed, but again he
seemed to decompensate with low grade temps and worsening
leukocytosis, so cefepime and vancomycin were restarted.  Serial
CXRs done on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] showed improvement in the LUL opacity
but development of a new LLL opacity and left sided pleural
effusion.  On [**3-20**], a chest CT was done which revealed a
significant left pleural effusion with LLL collapse.  The MET
service was called in for a thoracentesis. 600cc was removed
from the left lung, and sent for testing, which revealed an
exudative effusion without malignant cells.  Cultures were
negative.  An induced sputum was also done (as the patient was
not clearing his secretions) and grew sparce OP flora. Repeat CT
scan one week later showed marked resolution of LLL effusion. He
had evidence of progressing pneumonia, with new right sided tree
and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities. However clinically he appeared to be
improving, with decreased oxygen requirement and no further
fevers. Interventional pulmonary and pulmonary were consulted
for re-evaluation, but neither bronchosopy or re-tapping of left
sided pleural effusion were felt to be indicated. Given the
known suseptibility of his pneumococcus he was started again on
IV levofloxacin 500mg daily and cefepime and vancomycin were
discontinued. He remained afebrile on 3 days of IV therapy and
was therefore switched to PO regimen. His primary infectious
disease physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss his case.
It was felt that he should stay on Levofloxacin indefinitely
until a repeat CT scan may be performed as an outpatient to
document clearance of his infection. At that point he may need
chronic suppressive therapy, possibly with penicillin. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] on [**4-17**] and with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1058**]
on [**5-3**].

CHEST PAIN
On admission the patient complained of pleuritic left-sided
chest pain.  EKG did not show changes consistent with ACS, and
one set of cardiac enzymes was negative.  Once extubated and
transferred to the floor, he comtinued to have significant
discomfort.  His pain was pleuritic but was also worse with
palpation.  An EKG showed isolated TWI in V2 and another set of
cardiac enzymes was flat.  CXR at that time showed only
improving LUL opacity.  The pain was attributed to left-sided
pleural inflammation secondary to his known infection.  He was
started on narcotic pain medications, which somewhat controlled
the pain.  The pain service was also consulted to help the
primary team manage the complicated pain issues in this patient.
They suggested adding methadone and a lidoderm patch, with
ibuprofen if tolerated, with plan to taper off of oxycontin. The
main concern over opiate analgesics was his prior history of
substance abuse. However after discussion with the team, it was
felt that he had a legitimate reason for pleuritic pain, so he
was kept on both oxycontin and methadone for optimal pain
control, in addition to lidoderm patch. This regimen led to very
good pain control, with patient reporting 0/10 pain. Therefore
the plan is to taper off methadone slowly as pain continues to
resolve concurrently with his pneumonia. At the time of
discharge he is on 20mg oxycodone SR [**Hospital1 **] and 7.5 mg Methadone
TID. We will taper him down to 5mg [**Hospital1 **] Methadone, and this may
be tapered off over the next 1-2 weeks as his symptoms continue
to improve. He may be maintained on the oxycodone as needed for
long-term pain control. At the time of discharge he was also
re-started on Neurontin for his chronic neuropathic leg pain.

HYPOTENSION
As above, the patient became hypotensive in the ED.  This was
thought to be likely [**1-9**] septic shock, and he was quickly weaned
off pressors.  He underwent a cortisol stimulation test, which
showed an AM cortisol of 17, but the level did not respond to
cosyntropin.  Therefore, he was given a 7 day of hydrocortisone
and fludrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency.  Blood
pressures improved and remained stable. He did have a subsequent
transient episode of low blood pressures to 80's systolic, felt
likely to increased pain medications and volume depletion to
poor PO intake. He responded well to NS IVF boluses, and
remained HD stable the remainder of his course. Subsequent
re-check of am cortisol showed a normal level.

ANEMIA
The patient is s/p an extensive prior workup.  During this
hospitalization he was guiac negative.  His HCT was generally in
the low to mid 20s, and he was given a unit of PRBCs with an
appropriate HCT bump.  A reticulocyte count revealed appropriate
marrow production.  Iron studies were repeated during this
admission and were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease,
possibly secondary to his HIV.

HIV
The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**] for his HIV.  He has
been off HAART medications given significant depression and
suicidality at times.  He continues to be on dapsone prophylaxis
for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] most recent CD4 count was 227 and viral load was
52,000 in [**11-10**].

HCV
Similarly, treatment of his HCV has been deferred.  His most
recent viral load was in [**2140**] was 4,480,000.

Depression
The patient is not currently on treatment for his depression and
did not express any suicidal ideation during this inpatient
stay.  He was seen by [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1061**] while here, with plan to
follow-up in clinic after his rehab stay to readdress any social
needs or possible drug rehabilation program if needed.

Incidentally found on chest CT and should be f/u with MR [**First Name (Titles) 3**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1062**]t.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:
46 y/o man with HIV/AIDS, Hep C, presents with productive cough,
fever, chills, night sweats X 2 weeks, found to have RLL
infiltrate on CXR.
1.  Infiltrate on CXR:  DDX includes community acquired PNA, TB,
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1065**], viral, atypical PNA.  As pt has h/o
hospitalizations MRSA also possible.  Initially started on
Vancomycin, IV ceftriaxone, azithromycin.  Blooc Cx, sputum
cultures, ua and urine cultures.  He was given supplemental O2.
Plan was for bronchosopy.  While he was at [**Last Name (un) 1066**] he had an
episode where he was noted to be progressively more short of
breath and tachypneic, RR 20.  SpO2 80% on NRB.  pt did not get
bronch and was transferred to MICu for possible intubation.
ABGs on NRB mask 7.46/31/366.  In the MICU he was sating well
after transfer to ICU.  He was weaned of NRB and to 4L NC
quickly.  In discussion with ID, the Zosyn was discontinued, and
he was kept on CTX, vancomycin,a d azithromycin for a probable
CAP. PCp ws felt to be less likely based on improving
oxygenation and radiographic evidence, and so PCP regimen was
[**Name9 (PRE) 1067**].  MS contin and morphine for pain control.  Crypto ag
was negative, CMV vl, [**Name9 (PRE) **] and AFB were sent.  He got a
induced sputum AM of [**2144-2-7**].  There after patient stated that he
wanted to leave the hospital.  Multiple attempts to counsel
patient regarding the risks of leaving by several team memebers
were unsuccessful.  He was given Azithro for 7 days and
Cefpodoxime for 2 weeks for PNA.  He was advised on the results
of induced sputum with PCP and to finish the antibiotics.

Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated; extubated successfully


History of Present Illness:
48 y.o. M with h/o AIDS (CD 4 105 [**11-13**]), HCV, asthma, h/o TB,
h/o PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] was found down today by VNA [**12-9**] sitting in urine
"indian" style.  Unknown down time, patient was last seen on
[**2145-12-6**].  Patient was responsive to touch with grimaces, but
not following comands.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] brother was [**Name (NI) 653**] and full code
was confirmed in ED, along with confirmation by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was subsequently intubated after Etomidate/Succinylcholine.
Patient's VS were 96.8, patient was placed on bearhugger, they
were 101.6 upon transfer to the MICU.  Patient's HR was 122
initially, after given 1 L NS, then 3 L LR, and his HR was down
to 60-70s.  His SBP remained in 140s-160s.  Patient was
oxygenating well on 2L (100%) but was intubated for airway
protection.  Patient was started on propofol gtt for
precautions.  He was started on vanco/zosyn/CTX.
Patient of note recently admitted on [**11-30**] to [**12-2**] after being
found down, however patient left after full completion of
medical therapy.  It is very likely that he is noncompliant with
his medications.
Patient in ED had a L IJ placed, RIJ was attempted but was
complicated by R carotid puncture.  Patient subsequently has a 6
cm hematoma on the R side.  His CTA is also concerning for
possible opportunistic infectious including TB.
ROS: patient unable to provide.

studies:
CT abd/pelvis [**2145-12-9**]: 1. Nodular opacities within a
bronchovascular distribution most notable in the left lung base
and less so on the right most consistent with aspiration
pneumonia given clinical history. However given
immunocompromised status atypical infections including
tuberculosis must be considered and respirtory precautions
advised.  2. Cystic pancreatic tail lesion also noted on study
from [**2141**] without detectable change.  3. Generalized cachexia,
likely AIDS-wasting syndrome
.
CT C-spine [**2145-12-9**]: 1. Right supraclavicular fossa hematoma
corresponding with recent central venous line attempt in this
location.  2. No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.  3.
Partially imaged right apical opacity and right apical
subpleural blebs.
.
CT head [**2145-12-9**]: 1. No acute hemmorage or mass effect.  2. Mild
cerebral atrophy which is not age appropriate consistent with
HIV encephalopathy.  3. Confluent regions of hypoattenuation in
the deep white matter which is unchanged from [**Month (only) 1096**] yet new
since [**2141**]. While this may represent sequlae of HIV
encephalopathy, an underlying infectious etiology such as PML
may be considered and an MRI may be helpful.
.
CXR [**2145-12-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly low lying ET tube, approximately 3 cm above the
carina. This could be withdrawn slightly.
2. Small, patchy opacities at the left lung base which appear to
correspond to tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities seen on previous chest CT
.
MRI head [**2145-12-10**]: 1. No evidence of bacterial or fungal
infection. However, extensive white matter hyperintensity is
often found in patients with HIV encephalopathy.  2. Several
foci of apparent infarction or encephalitis in the corpus
callosum raise the possibility of meningitis.
.
Echo [**2145-12-13**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A 24mmHg peak mid-cavitary
gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-2-6**],
left ventricular systolic function is now dynamic with a higher
heart rate and mild resting mid-cavitary gradient.
Is there a history to suggest a high output state (e.g.,
thiamine deficiency, hyperthyroidism, anemia, fever, etc.?

Brief Hospital Course:
48 y.o. M with h/o HIV/AIDs, h/o TB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] infections,
noncompliant with his medications, recent history of
falls/traumas found down for possibly three days, minimally
responsive, intubated for airway protection.  The course also
complicated by R neck hematoma due to line placement, alkalosis,
hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, improved ARF, elevated lactate,
transaminitis.

# AMS - multifactorial.  Was found down and c-collar placed.
Came with elevated CKs consistent with Rhabdomyalysis, improved
with IVFs.  Concern for toxic metabilic encephalopathy
(infection, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia) as well as HIV
encephalopathy.  He was intubated for airway protection.  He was
treated with broad ABX as detailed below.  Metabolic
abnormalities improved with IVFs, and he had a negative LP for
infection, but.  MRI was also negative for stroke or mass
lession.  His mental status improved and he was extubated, but
he is not at baseline (he walked out of [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-12-1**] after
signing out against medical advise).   CT c-spine was negative
for fracture, but his C-collar was not cleared due to ongoing
altered mental status.  He currently follows some commands but
remains globally weak and will require a neurology consult to
address this and his mental status.  He was given limited
narcotics for pain of undetermined source (seemed in pain with
even light touch to skin).  Would recommend not using too much
narcotics for pain as it will likely cloud mental status.

# ID - AIDs pt not on HAART.   Infectious disease team was
consulted and followed throughout his hospitalization.
Initially, he was covered broadly initially with
vanco/cefepime/flagyl.  He was also on Acycovir to cover for HSV
encephalitis, but this was stopped when CSF was negative for
HSV.  The pt underwent LP and Bronchoscopy.  He had blood,
urine, sputum, stool, and CSF sent for culture.  Stool was
positive for Cdiff on [**2145-12-10**].  He needs to continue on flagyl
for 14 days after all other ABX completed.  Sputum was positive
for MRSA on [**2145-12-10**], and he needs a 14 day course of vancomycin
(currenly, today [**12-16**] is day #8).  He also had pseudomonas
(sparse growth) in sputum and GNRs not otherwise speciated in
his sputum [**2145-12-12**], and Cefepime changed to Zosyn and then to
Meropenem for gram negative coverage.  Meropenem course is 15
days (currently, today [**2145-12-16**] is day #5).  Of note, 1 colony of
Aspergillus was grown on [**2145-12-12**] from sputum and a CT chest was
done on [**2145-12-16**] which did not reveal evidence of invasive
aspergillus.  Galactomannan was sent and needs to be followed
up.  ID recommended NOT to start treatment for aspergillus.  Pt
needs to follow up with ID, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**], within 2-3 weeks.
Appointment needs to be scheduled.

# Hypernatremia - Felt due to poor free water intake intake and
dehydration while on ground at home.  He was given IVFs and free
H20 and his sodium returned to [**Location 213**] (139 at time of
discharge).

# C-collar - CT c-spine negative, but could not clear collar due
to altered mental status.  Pt needs to have this cleared at
rehab

# Rhabdomylosis - likely due to being down, CK peaked at 3996,
and improved to normal with IVFs.  Renal failure resolved.

# ARF - likely prerenal with component of rhabdomylosis.  Cr 1.6
upon admission, improved to 0.6 by the time of discharge.

# transaminitis - Known Hep C.  Levels were monitored and
trended down to normal by the time of d/c.

# R neck hematoma - stable clinically.  Serial Hcts were checked
and remained stable.

# PPx - H2 [**Hospital1 **], Heparin SQ, senna/colace

# FEN: He was initiated on tube feeds.  He needs a speech and
swallow evaluation to see if he can protect his airway with PO
intake.  Hypernatremia and hypercalcemia resolved with IVFs

.
ED Course:  arrived [**1-13**] @9pm. Never oriented, drowsy --> very
agitated.  VS 98.5, HR 97, PB 134/89, RR 16, 02 sat 100% on 2L.
Negative head CT.  Midnight - noted to have tonic clonic seizure
activity lasting 1-2 minutes, post-ictal.  O2 sat 100% on non
rebreather, weaned easily.  Given Ceftriaxone 2gm, Vanc 1gm,
Ampicillin 2gm, Acyclovir 700mg. Sedated for LP (2mg Versed and
2mg Ativan).  200mg IV Diflucan for thrush.  Morphine for pain,

being found down and minimally responsive; he was intubated for
airway protection; course complicated by R neck hematoma [**1-8**] to
line placement, alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypercacemia, improved
ARF, elevated lactate, transaminitis.  Concern for toxic
metabolic encephalopathy, improved somewhat with fluids but did
not return to baseline. Also with rhabdomylosis - CK peaked at
3996, and improved to normal with IVFs, renal failure also
resolved.  He was positive for c-diff, had MRSA positive sputum,
and sparse pseudomonas growth in sputum. When discharged he
needed 6 more days to finish 14 day course of vancomycin, 10
more days to complete 15 day course of meropenem and needed to
continue on flagyl for 14 days after all other ABX completed.

than 1 ppd x 25 years), + h/o IVDA in past, occasional marijuana
use.  No EtOh.  Sexually active "occasionally" with one partner,
same partner for several years.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Admission Physical Exam:
VS: Temp: 98.1 BP: 142/100 HR: 112 RR: 20 O2sat 100% 2L
GEN: agitated, crying out, not oriented, cachectic
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MM dry, thrush on tongue
NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no
carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules
RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout
CV: tachy, RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g
ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, initially with voluntary guarding but
later without
EXT: no c/c/e, warm, good pulses
SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice
NEURO: AAOx0, unable to cooperate with neuro exam

At discharge, vitals were stable.  The patient was afebrile.
The patient was more oriented.  He was able to communicate his
needs in English.  His neck was rotated the left and he had some
muscular spasm.  His abdomen was benign.  The remained of his
exam was unchanged.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2146-1-23**]): Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. NG tube
tip is in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. The lungs are grossly clear. Surgical clips projecting
over the left supraclavicular area are again noted. Left PICC
remains in place.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia, rate 115 beats per minute. Right atrial
abnormality. Possible old septal myocardial infarction. Possible
left ventricular hypertrophy. Tracing is compatible with
pulmonary disease. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-12-9**] QS
complexes in leads V1-V2 are less prominent and there is less
suggestion of possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Both
tracings are compatible with pulmonary disease.

CT Head ([**2146-1-13**]):
FINDINGS: Multiple acquisitions were performed due to patient
compliance. Despite this, there is motion artifact on the study
acquired limiting the evaluation.

There again noted is extensive confluent low attenuation
throughout the deep white matter of the brain. This is likely
related to underlying HIV encephalopathy. There is a advance
atrophy for age which is consistently seen in HIV encephalopathy
as well. There is no acute interval change or midline shift. No
intracranial hemorrhage is evident.

IMPRESSION: Stable head CT examination, although the current
examination is limited as above. Findings most consistent with
HIV encephalopathy with no superimposed acute process.

CT Neck: FINDINGS:

The patient is rotated to the left side, with the neck being
rotated to the left side. Hence, this study is limited in
acquiring the images in a proper manner, centered onto the
midline of the neck. In addition, lack of IV contrast,
significantly limits evaluation for any focal infection.

Within these limitations, there are no large masses noted on the
visualized images of the neck.

However, subtle areas of increased attenuation in the fat and
inflammation cannot be assessed.

There is moderate dilatation of the esophagus with small amount
of fluid/debris within the esophagus. This finding is new
compared to the CT chest on [**2145-12-16**], with interval removal of
the nasogastric tube.
Right-sided PICC line is incompletely included on the present
study.

There are a few surgical clips, noted lateral to the left side
of the thyroid, unchanged in position, compared to the prior CT
chest on [**2145-12-16**].

There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized
images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the
head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present
study.

There is a small 4-mm soft tissue density nodule in the upper
lobe of the left lung, unchanged.

There appears to be resolution of the previously noted
pneumothorax in the apices. However, the chest is not completely
evaluated on the present study.

There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized
images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the
head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Seizures:  The patient had two witnessed tonic-clonic seizures
before presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and one seizure in the ED.  The
most likely etiology for patient's seizures is imipenem which
was used to treat his urine culture positive for acinetobacter
and elavil which was given at high doses for neuropathy. Mr.
[**Known lastname 1071**] is thought to have HIV encephalopathy and this condition
combined with imipenem may have lowered his seizure threshold.
Patient's amitriptyline was also considered as possible cause of
patient's seizures.

Infectious etiology or mass effect were ruled out by [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course, benign appearance of CSF, and head CT;
however, initially the patient was given empiric IV acyclovir,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin because of suspicion of viral or
bacterial central nervous system infection. Of note, patient has
had no seizures since admission and stopping of imipenem and
amitriptyline. The patient was started on 500 mg levetiracetam
(Keppra) [**Hospital1 **] as anti-seizure medication.  Per the neurology
service, the patient should be on Keppra indefinitely.

# Mental status changes:  The patient's mental status changes
are likely due to HIV encephalopathy.   CT showed no CNS mass
effect and no acute CNS infectious etiology found.  Patient's
mental status changes date back to [**11-13**] admission when patient
left hospital AMA, never having gone back to baseline mental
status s/p presumed fall.   Patient's CMV viral loads were low
(2160) and treatment was deferred since there was no sign
end-organ disease.  The patient was examined by Ophthomaology
who did not see any signs of CMV retinitis.

# Urine:  The patient was found to have acinetobacter in his
urine sensitive to gentamicin.  He was started on a three day
course of IV gentamicin on [**1-26**].  He will need his final dose
today at rehab ([**2146-1-28**]).  Please recheck a UA and culture
tomorrow ([**2146-1-29**]) to confirm his urine has cleared
appropriately.  The patient has also had urinary retention
during this hospitalization.  He failed two voiding trials
during this stay.  As he improves, he can be given another
voiding trial or can follow up with Urology if needed.

# Neck position:  The patient had head turned to left and was
resistant to changing position and has point tenderness
bilaterally on sides of neck.  Neck CT without contrast obtained
(could not use contrast as could not obtain peripheral IV access
necessary) but study was inconclusive due to patient positioning
and lack of contrast.  Patient continuesd to keep head turned to
left with some improvement noted with use of clonazepam.  Please
continue low dose clonazepam to help with muscular spasm.  If
the patient continues to have neck pain, consider re-imaging the
neck.

# Allodynia:  The patient had complaints of allodynia on last
admission and reports of neuropathic pain dating back to [**2142**].
This allodynia may be part of the spectrum of his neuropathy
which is thought to be secondary to HIV.  According to OMR, the
patient has not had relief of his neuropathy with gabapentin in
the past.  However, after patient left ICU for floor, opiates
were held because of worries of sedation affecting mental
status.  His pain was treated with gabapentin and acetaminophen.
 We did not restart his opiates during this hospitalization nor
his Remeron.

# Hypokalemia/hypomagnesmia:  On admission, the patient was
hypokalemic (K of 3.0) and hypomagnesemic (1.1).  Patient's poor
nutrition (albumin of 2.6) and no PO intake most likely cause.
As feeding via NG tube began, lytes were monitored [**Hospital1 **] in order
to assess refeeding syndrome.  At the time of discharge, the
patient's PO intake was improving.  He was able to eat his
entire breakfast with help from the nursing staff.  Please
continue to monitor his electrolytes while he is on TPN at least
daily replete his electrolytes as needed and change TPN based on
electrolytes.  Once he is able to increase his PO intake, please
consider discontinuing the TPN.  Once discontinued, the patient
will not need his electrolytes monitored daily.  Please
discontinue his PICC line once he no longer needs TPN.

# HIV:  The patient is not on HAART (as he has declined it).  ID
did not recommend HAART as HAART carries increased risk of
toxicity in setting of poor nutrition, and patient is vulnerable
to immune reconstitution syndrome with low CD4 count at start of
HAART and patient has known Hepatitis C.  ID's recommendation
was that HAART not be initiated until Mr. [**Known lastname 1101**] nutritional
status improves and that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] (outpatient ID doctor for
patient) should make decisions about implementing HAART.
Patient has follow up appointment on [**3-2**] at 9:30 AM with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**].  Please continue his Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

# Fluid, electrolytes, nutrion:  Patient was profoundly
cachectic, had not eaten in several days and failed a speech and
swallow evaluation.  GI did not wish to place PEG because of
patient's low albumin (which would impede healing) and prominent
epigastric surgical scar.  Patient received NG tube on [**2146-1-21**]
after neck was imaged with CT.  NG tube feeds began at midnight
on night of [**2146-1-21**] at 10 ml/hr.  Rate was increased by 10 ml/hr
every 12 hours with a goal rate of 50 ml/hour acheived at
midnight on Sunday [**2146-1-23**].  However, tube came out and patient
refused replacement.  Patient did ask for tube to be replaced on
[**1-25**] but after primary medical team could not place tube,
patient refused IR placement of NG tube.  Patient was begun on
TPN on [**2146-1-27**].  Patient's lytes were repleted PRN as mentioned
above.  The patient is having improved PO intake and TPN can be
discontinued when patient is taking adequate oral intake.  If
needed, the patient can be re-evaulated by Speech and swallow in
the future.

Despite numerous discussions with the family regarding poor
prognosis, the patient remained full code throughout his
hospital course.

Physical Exam:
98.2, 68, 100/48, RR15, 98% on RA
Gen:  Cachectic appearing elderly male, resting comfortably in
bed, appearing in pain with movement.
Neck: No JVD.
Cor: RR, normal rate, no m/r/g.
Lungs: CTA b/l.
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND
Extr: No c/c/e.  R BKA.  Swollen, erythematous R knee,
exquisitely tender.  Trace PT on the L.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-28**] AP, LATERAL AND SUNRISE VIEWS OF THE PATELLA: No prior
studies are available for comparison. There is a horizontal
fracture through the patella with 1.2 cm of displacement of the
fragments anteriorly. There is a small joint effusion. There are
changes from prior BKA, and extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] calcifications
are present.
IMPRESSION: Horizontal patellar fracture with 1.2 cm of
displacement anteriorly.

[**3-28**] PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP, THREE VIEWS: There is a transverse
lucency through the femoral neck, which may represent a
nondisplaced fracture. No other fractures or dislocations are
identified. Degenerative changes of the SI and hip joints are
noted. There is diffuse demineralization. Extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
calcifications and iliac stents are noted.
IMPRESSION: Transverse lucency through the femoral neck, which
may represent a nondisplaced fracture.

[**3-28**] CT PELVIS:  There is a nondisplaced fracture of the
proximal right femoral neck. No other fractures or dislocations
are identified. There is diffuse osteopenia. There is a small
amount of high attenuation fluid within the right hip joint
space, which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage.
Extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] calcifications are seen as are bilateral
iliac stents. Visualized portions of the pelvis are
unremarkable. Soft tissue structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced fracture of the right femoral neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with extensive medical history, notably
including CAD s/p CABG in [**2117**], MI [**2123**], MIBI with fixed and
reversible defects in [**2129**], CHF with EF 20%, PVD s/p R BKA with
b/l iliac stents, AAA found to be 5.4 x 5.0 cm on recent
abdominal US, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who uses a RLE
prosthesis for ambulation s/p R BKA, who presents s/p mechanical
fall with R patellar and R femoral neck fractures, here for
orthopedic surgery.

1) Ortho:  Patient is high risk for surgery, however per ortho,
surgery will not be extensive, could be completed in relatively
short time frame, possibly under spinal anesthesia only.
Awaiting cardiolgy consult for estimate of operative risk given
recent MIBI with reversible defects in all territories, and cath
with 3VD.  Patient willing to accept 25-30% chance of operative
mortality.  [**Year (4 digits) **] has seen patient and says o.k. for surgery.
 Limiting factor may be INR, as still 2.9 with 5 mg Vitamin K.
Another 5 mg given, but may need FFP/platelets, and given EF
30%, would likely need to be done under controlled setting in
ICU in case of respiratory distress.  [**Month (only) 116**] defer until tomorrow.
Needs patellar surgery one way or another in order to ever be
able to use prosthesis again.

2) AAA:  Seen by [**Month (only) 1106**].  Will try to get CTA during
hospitalization at some point, though not now in setting of
worsened creatinine.  [**Month (only) 116**] just be able to get abdominal US.
Appreciate [**Month (only) 1106**] consult.  Outpatient repair of AAA.

3) CHF:  Class [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 20% in past, though 30% on most recent
cath, currently dry on exam, therefore holding lasix.  If
patient doesn't go to surgery tonight, will order food and will
likely order lasix then.  Also will need lasix with any
FFP/platelets.
-Coumadin for goal INR [**1-10**]

4) PVD:  Bilateral iliac stents, on coumadin, therefore once INR
below 2, will have to start heparin drip.
--recheck INR post second dose of vitamin K, if < 2.0, will
start heparin, and d/c prior to surgery

5) A-fib: As above, holding coumadin.

6) CRI:  Slightly above baseline.  Holding ACE-I.

7) FEN:  K borerline therefore holding ACE-I.  No fluids.  Will
order food if pt. doesn't go to OR.

8) Code: Full.

9) PPx: Heparin drip then transfer to coumadin, senna, colace.

Removed RIJ CVL and placed peripheral IV on [**2132-4-9**]. Hct 29.7 on
discharge. Needs daily Hct and INR. Transfuse Hct<28 and keep
INR [**1-10**].

respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
85-year-old female atrial fibrillation, schizophrenia, dementia
presents from nursing home with respiratory distress.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until this AM. At
that time she was found by nursing home staff in respiratory
distress with O2 sats of 70% on RA. EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she
was started on supplemental oxygen with NRB and O2 sats
responded to 98%. She was also noted to be hot (no document of

MICRO:
[**2179-1-29**] Blood culture: pending
.
IMAGING:
[**2179-1-29**] EKG #1: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R wave progression could be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot
exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

[**2179-1-29**] EKG #2: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular
response. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R wave progression could be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot
exclude ischemia. Compared to tracing #1 ventricular rate is
slower.

[**2179-1-29**] CXR:
1. Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Mild cardiomegaly.
3. Hyperexpanded lungs, could be due to emphysema.

[**2179-1-29**] CTA Head/Neck:
1. Acute right MCA distribution infarction with acute occlusion
demonstrated within the right middle cerebral artery. No
collateral flow.
2. No evidence of vascular dissection. Mild atherosclerotic
plaque as
detailed above.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old female with a history of schizophrenia and dementia
who presented in repiratory distress and was found to have a new
MCA stroke. After goals of care discussion with patient's
guardian, she was made comfort measures only, and expired on
[**2179-2-2**].

#. Respiratory Distress: Patient's O2 sats were in high 90s on
NRB on arrival to ED.  She was noted to be in afib with RVR, and
CXR was concerning for pulmonary edema.  Patient was treated
with nitro gtt, diltiazem, aspirin, levofloxacin and furosemide.
BiPAP attempted, but patient did not tolerate well; developed
hypotension and increased tachycardia.  She was admitted to the
ICU for further evaluation and management of respiratory
distress. After Code Stroke called on arrival to ICU in setting
of left hemiparesis (see below), and imaging revealed large R
MCA infarct, decision was made to focus on comfort care only.
Patient transferred to floor, where she received morphine as
needed for pain and SOB.
.
#. CVA: On arrival to ICU, patient was noted to have left
hemiparesis.  Code Stroke called, and CT Head/Neck revealed
right MCA infarct. Given the history of recent falls and her
limited pre-stroke functionality, the decision was made not to
give heparin or tPA.  After discussion with the patient's
guardian, it was felt that she would not want to pursue
aggressive treatment given poor prognosis, and patient was made
CMO.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to be in afib with RVR on
presentation.  She was initially on diltiazem gtt, but this was
discontinued once patient made CMO.
.
#. Rash: Patient noted to have papular rash on erythematous
background on neck and abdomen.  Was felt to be most likely
secondary to a drug rash.  Of note, patient received lasix,
which may have caused reaction as patient has history of sulfa
allergy.  Patient received sarna lotion as needed, as well as
hydrocortisone cream.
.
#. Goals of care: Per discussion with patient's guardian,
patient's code status changed to comfort measures only.  Plan
was for discharge back to skilled nursing facility with hospice,
however patient expired on [**2179-2-2**] prior to discharge.  Her
guardian was notified, and declined an autopsy.

Chief Complaint:
Abd pain and N/V


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p right and left hemicolectomy

History of Present Illness:
60F with ESRD s/p deceased donor renal transplant, HTN, and
diverticulitis who was initially admitted for worsening
abdominal pain and N/V and now presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
hypotension after having a n ex-lap and bowel resection for a
perforated cecum.  She has had approximately 3 episodes of
diverticulitis in the past year which resolved with antibiotics.
 She was planning to have an elective outpatient laparoscopic
colectomy given her frequent flares.  Prior to this admission,
she reportedly had intermittent [**10-3**] abdominal pain in the RLQ
and LLQ and significant nausea and vomiting, she was unable to
keep down any POs for 48 hours prior to admission.  This felt
worse than her prior diverticulitis flares and she was admitted
for observation, hydration, and antibiotics.  CT abd/pelvis at
admission showed pericolonic stranding but no e/o
diverticulitis.

Since admission to the surgery service, she was staretd on Cipro
and Flagyl for the colitis seen on CT.  Her abdominal pain
acutely worsened on [**5-12**] and she described feeling a "[**Doctor Last Name **]" in
her abdomen.  A repeat CT abd/pelvis showed perforation at the
cecum with free air present and extravasation of PO contrast
into the peritoneum.  She was taken to the OR for a ex-lab where
she was found to have a stricture in the signoid colon and a
perforation in her cecum with spillage of stool in to the
peritoneum.  She underwent a right and left colectomy, the
transverse colon was left in place but is discontinusous.  Her
abdomen was left open after the procedure.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2114-5-12**] 8:07 PM
Supine and decubitus view of the abdomen shows pneumoperitoneum,

not present on the abdomen CT [**5-11**], but detected on the chest
radiograph
performed concurrently and reported prior to review of this
study. Retained contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in the cecum shows its diameter
is 8 cm.  Proximal to it, the small bowel is moderately
distended to a diameter of 28 mm.  A subsequent abdominal CT
scan also available at the time of this review shows the effects
of likely cecal perforation.

IMAGING:
-[**5-12**] CT Abd:
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is evidence of new bowel perforation at the level of
the cecum, with evidence of new free air, free fluid, as well as
extraluminal oral contrast surrounding the cecum.  Surgical
consultation is recommended.
2.  Pericolonic stranding is again noted diffusely throughout
the colon and greatest throughout the descending and sigmoid
colon.  These findings are most consistent with diffuse colitis
which has likely led to perforation.
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2114-5-14**]  11:12:58 AM
Sinus rhythm with low amplitude P waves. Low QRS voltage
throughout.
Delayed R wave transition. Diffuse non-specific T wave
flattening. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-7-15**] the
voltage is lower. P wave amplitude has decreased. Diffuse T wave
flattening is present. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2114-5-15**] 3:19 AM
No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low endotracheal tube
position.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1119**], a patient known to the colorectal surgery service,
presented to the emergency department on [**2114-5-11**] with nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with
diverticulitis and she was evaluated by the acute care service
in the emergency department and a plan was formulated with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] to admit the patient for abdominal exams, antibiotics and
rehydration with plan to monitor and expedite surgical plans
based on her medical history and sudden relapse of symptoms
while on outpatient antibiotic therapy. Nephrology was consulted
for advice related to immunosuppression medications and past
renal transplant and followed the patient for the duration of
her inpatient admission. On [**2114-5-12**] the patient was monitored
closely. She was started on a clear liquid diet and was given a
Dulcolax Supp x1 and had 2 bowel movements. She remained
distended and was given a dose of milk of magnesia. The patient
was improving when she had a sudden onset of abdominal pain. CT
revealed extravasation of contrast and she was taken to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for exploratory laparotomy and
two segmental colectomies, was left with open abdomen and
disconnected and because of the difficult case and condition of
bowel as described in the operative note, the patient was
transferred to the intensive care unit appropriate drains. On
[**2114-5-14**] the patient returned to the operating room with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] after stabilization in the ICU for washout, completion
proctectomy and colectomy, ileostomy and closure of the abdomen
with retention sutures and staples. The patient was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and the course of ICU care is described below.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] resident:
60F with ESRD s/p deceased renal transplant in [**2095**] on
immunosuppression, HTN and h/o diverticulitis who presented to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension after ex-lap with right/left
hemicolectomy performed for cecal perforation and sigmoid
stricture.
.
#Cecal perforation s/p colectomy:  The cause of her perforation
was thought to be a sigmoid stricture which was found
intraoperatively, likely related to her multiple episodes of
diverticulitis.   She had a primary anastomosis and loop
ileostomy. She was commenced on vanc/Zosyn for an 8 day course
per surgery, and was maintained on a morphine PCA prn. She was
intubated for the procedure, but was quickly and successfully
weaned off of the vent prior to callout to the surgical floor.
.
# Hypertension ?????? Her initial hypotension resolved, and her home
anti-hypertensives were recommenced due to her hx of HTN.
.
#ESRD s/p renal transplant: renal transplant recs were followed,
and after her procedure, she was restarted on azathioprine, and
transitioned to a 5mg daily dose of prednisone. She was
restarted on cyclosporine per renal transplant on [**5-17**]. .
#Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Likely related to
volume resuscitation with NS. Chloride is also elevated which
supports this.
.
#Anemia: Hct trending down almost 10 points compared to her
pre-op CBC.  Likely from blood loss during her colectomy as well
as dilutional effect from multiple fluid boluses.  She was also
hemoconcentrated at admission from poor PO intake and has
baseline anemia with Hct in the 24-32 range from her ESRD s/p
transplant. She was transfused with packed red blood cells. She
was monitored closely.

The patient was extubated and started on a clear liquid diet on
[**2114-5-17**].

Surgical Floor Course:

The patient was transferred to the inpatient floor on [**2114-5-18**]
and began a regular diet. She was continued on her antibiotic
course. [**2114-5-19**] the Foley was removed at midnight. The patient
had temporary central venous access which was not ideal for the
floor and because of intravenous antibiotics and the patient's
access status  unable to place PICC line after multiple
attempts. IR was unable to schedule the patient for IR placement
of the PICC line. The nursing staff continued to use the CVL for
access. On [**2114-5-20**] the patient was voiding. She was given
vancomycin 500x1, troughs were monitored closely at the patient
was a renal transplant patient and she was strated on pain
medications by mouth. [**2114-5-21**] Renal transplant fellow:
recommend continuing home dose of immunosuppression medications.
JP drains were removed. The patient was meeting discharge
criteria. She was followed closely throughout her admission by
the wound/ostomy nursing team as well as physical therapy. After
consultation with the nephrology team the patient was started on
a 14 day course of Augmentin started and fluconazole and Zosyn
were discontinued. The PICC line was pulled back to midline
position and the central venous line was removed without issue.
Her cyclosporine trough was monitored closely throughout her
hospitalization as there was a risk of interaction with
fluconazole. Her last trough was 112 on [**2114-5-19**]. She continued
her Cyclosporine and was discharged on appropriate dosing. The
patient was ordered to have the Cyclosporine trough measured
prior to the morning dose on [**2114-5-24**] and dose adjustment with
assistance of the renal transplant center. Arrangements were
arranged for the patient to be transferred to a rehabilitation
facility appropriately as she had become deconditioned. The
midline catheter was removed at time of discharge.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care - [**Location (un) 1121**]
([**Hospital3 1122**] Center)

Discharge Diagnosis:
Sigmoid diverticulitis with abscess and stricture, perforated
cecum


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a laparoscopic
Colectomy for surgical management of your diverticulitis.
Unfortunately after this procedure you were found to have a
stricture and leaking into your abdomen which required you to be
taken back to the operating room for a completion colectomy and
end ileostomy. Closure of the surgical incision required
placement of retention sutures which remain in place and will
stay in place along with the staples until you return for your 2
weeks post-operative visit. You have recovered from this
procedure and you are now ready to return home. Samples from
your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the
pathology department for analysis. You will receive these
pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an
urgent need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these
results they will contact you before this time. You have
tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is
controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return home
to finish your recovery. It is important that you continue to
have your immunosupression medications monitored for your kidney
transplant. Please have your level checked at rehab the morning
of [**2114-5-24**] and the goal of the cyclosporin level is 50-100. The
rehab should fax this level to the renal transplant office after
it is back for recommendations at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**]. This will be
ordered in your paperwork however, it is the facilities
responsibility to order the test.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. If you have any of
the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go
to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal
distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
inability to tolerate food or liquids, elevated ileostomy
output. You have a new ileostomy. The most common complication
from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from
the stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water
content is very high. The stool is no longer passing through the
large intestine which is where the water from the stool is
reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. You must
measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output
from the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than
500cc. If you find that your output has become too much or too
little, please call the office for advice. The office nurse or
nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow
the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if you notice
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink
such as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms
of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing),
weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If you notice these
symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room
for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. You may eat a
regular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea
to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made
to you by the ostomy nurses.

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. The stoma
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be
beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed
above. Please care for the ostomy as you have been instructed by
the wound/ostomy nurses. You will be able to make an appointment
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. You
will have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks
helping to monitor your ostomy until you are comfortable caring
for it on your own. The bridge will be removed from the
ileostomy at your follow-up appointment with the wound/ostomy
nurses.

You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed
with staples and retention sutures. This incision can be left
open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the
staples become irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in
place until your first post-operative visit at which time they
can be removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse.
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may
shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat
the area dry with a towel, do not rub.

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless
instructed otherwise by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You may
gradually increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy
exercise with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You must continue to wear the
abdomoinal binder with a whole cut for the ileostomy to fit
under at least until your second post-operative visit with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. He will give you further instructions at this time.

You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication
Please take this medication exactly as prescribed. You may take
Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take more than
4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while taking
narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive a car
while taking narcotic pain medication.
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope
is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual
activities. Good luck!

STUDIES:
[**11-23**] Foot Xray:
1) Sensitivity for osteomyelitis somewhat limited by overlying
bandage.
2) Osteopenia, which is worse compared with [**2195-9-23**] and probably
slightly worse compared with [**2195-11-14**], but without definite
discrete bone destruction. Please see comment.

[**2195-11-24**]: TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-9-25**], a
left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension are now identified.

[**2195-11-25**]: Chest xray: In comparison with the earlier study of
this date, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. On the lateral view, there is substantial bilateral
pleural effusion. No evidence of vascular congestion.

[**2195-11-25**] Foot xray: Since the previous study, there has been
debridement at the first MTP joint.
Cortical irregularity at the base of the first proximal phalanx
and of the first metatarsal head is seen. There is gauze
material seen at the surgical site. There are prominent spurs
about the calcaneal tuberosity. There is a lot of soft tissue
swelling. Please refer to the operative note for additional
details.

[**2195-11-30**] Foot XR - There appears to have been resection of the
distal first metatarsal and base of the first proximal phalanx.
There is an overlying skin defect and associated subcutaneous
emphysema. Direct comparison to the [**2195-11-25**] films is limited
due to overlying bandage, but the bone resection is new compared
with [**2195-11-23**]. No other areas of focal osteolysis are identified
at this time.

PATHOLOGY:
[**2195-11-25**]
1.  Sesamoid, left foot (A):
-  Trabecular bone fragments with marrow fibrosis, acute
osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis.
- Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.
2.  Bone, left first metatarsal head (B-C):
-  Trabecular bone with marrow fibrosis, acute osteomyelitis and
osteonecrosis.
-  Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.
3.  Bone, base of hallux left foot (D):
-  Trabecular bone with focal osteonecrosis, acute inflammation,
marrow fibrosis, and extensive remodelling.
-  Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.

[**2195-11-30**] Left foot, proximal phalanx, excision (A):
- Markedly reactive bone with acute inflammation.
[**2195-11-30**] Left foot, clearing fragment, excision (B):
-   Bone with marked reactive changes.



Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo man with type 2 diabetes melitus, atrial fibrilation, and
chronic left foot osteomyelitis with cellulitis was admitted
with hypoglycemia and bradycardia.

1. Hypoglycemia: He was initially admitted to the ICU given
persistent hypoglycemia in the setting of recent bactrim use
with glipizide, which was thought to prolong the effects of the
glipizide. He required D50 boluses and an octreotide drip with
D10 in the ICU to maintain his blood sugar. His blood sugar
improved from 30's to 300's and the octreotide drip and D10 drip
were stopped. After his multiple podiatric procedures were
performed, his oral hypoglycemics were restarted and his blood
sugars remained stable between 80-200.

2. Bradycardia: Noted on admission, thought secondary to
elevated digoxin level and interaction with bactrim. His digoxin
and verapamil were initially held. They were then both restarted
once his many procedures were completed, and his heart rate
remained between 60-80s.

3. Left osteomyelitis and cellulitis: He was treated with
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and flagyl starting [**2195-11-23**]. He
underwent bone resection with podiatry [**2195-11-25**]. Based on
culutre results, pan-sensitive mssa and enterococcus, so
antibiotics were changed to unasyn on [**2195-11-28**]. He was taken
back to the OR for wound closure on [**2195-11-30**]. He was then
transitioned to augmentin. He was recommended to continue
augmentin at least until he follows up with his primary
podiatrist on [**2195-12-7**] at which time length of treatment course
will be decided. He was evaluated by physical therapy on the day
prior to discharge, and he was cleared to go home with home PT.
He was recommended to remain non-weight bearing on his left
foot.

4. Benign hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension
with poor blood pressure control. In the intensive care unit,
his systolic blood pressure rose to almost 200, requiring
treatment with hydralazine. The patient's home verapamil was
continued, but his lisinopril was discontinued due to
hyperkalemia. Lasix was used as needed for volume overload and
his lisinopril was restarted with improved blood pressure
control.

5. Volume overload: The patient developed increased work of
breathing and volume overload in the setting of his D10 drip.
The D10 drip was discontinued, and patient was treated with
Lasix, with improvement in his symptoms.

6. Type II Diabetes melitus, uncontrolled with complications:
His oral agents were held in house as above and glycemic control
achieved with sliding scale of insulin. He was restarted on both
his metformin and glipizide 24 hours prior to discharge, and his
blood sugars remained stable between 80-200.

7. Atrial fibrillation: He was rate controlled with verapamil
and digoxin. He is chronically anticoagulated with coumadin, and
was admitted with an inr of 9.3. He had no bleeding. He was
given vitamin k, with gradual improvement in his inr. His
coumadin was held. This was restarted on [**2195-11-30**], and his INR
was 2 on discharge.

8. Chronic diastolic heart failure: He was treated with
intermittent diuresis for volume overload. He was restarted on
ace inhibitor.

9. Anemia: He was noted to have anemia of chronic disease, with
stable hct.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1146**] was initially treated for a COPD exacerbation, which
was felt to be the primary contributor to her SOB especially
given that she wasn't on any inhalers at home despite an FEV1 of
25% predicted in [**2095**].  She was also ruled out for MI.  Her
creatinine initially trended down with gentle hydration.  On the
evening of [**2108-2-18**], she was found to be in Afib w/RVR to the
150s.  She was given metoprolol 5 mg IV x3 and diltiazem x 1
dose without successful slowing.  She became more tachypneic and
short of breath, and hypotensive to the 70s.  She was intubated,
cardioverted to NSR w/100 Jx1, and started on dopamine.  She was
transferred to the CCU.  Overnight, she went back into afib
w/RVR and required cardioversion twice (second time successful
at 200J).  She was only in NSR for a short time, and again went
back into afib.   She was bolused w/amiodarone 150 mg and begun
on an amio infusion at 1 mg/min.  Cardioversion was again
briefly successful but she ultimately went back into afib.  Her
dopamine was weaned off on [**2-19**].  Her rhythm was in and out of
afib but eventually converted to sinus with the amio infusion.
She had a TTE which revealed an EF 30-35%, repeat CXR c/w
worsening failure, and diuresis was attempted with a lasix gtt.
Her vent was changed from AC to PS but she became progressively
acidemic (ABG from 7.42/42/92 to 7.21/56/66).  Her creatinine
began to increase with the attempt at diuresis, from 1.0 to 1.5.
 At this point she also developed a cold/purple R foot, and a
heparin gtt was started.  This resolved the problem.  Vascular
surgery evaluated the pt and agreed with this treatment.
Because of her severe COPD, it was felt that it would be very
difficult to wean her from the vent.  At that point, there was a
discussion between the PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1147**] and the family, who
felt it was best to extubate her and keep her comfortable.  She
was then extubated at that time and given morphine for comfort.
She died at 3:15 pm on [**2108-2-22**] with her family by her side.

managed to crawl to window, yell for help, EMS arrived which
took pt to OSH. Pt has been recently hospitalized for malaise
[**Date range (1) 1163**]/[**2163**] and found to be in renal failure, which was
thought to be pre-renal in the setting of poor PO intake,
hypotension from adrenal insufficiency while off steriods. Her
Cr improved from 5.6 to 1.3 with IVF. She was also discharged on
cefuroxime for a UTI, abx to be completed [**6-24**]. Pt was
discharged to extended care facility on [**6-17**].
.

dropped to 84/53 received 3.3 L NS IVF, SO2 dropped to 89% RA
increased to 96% 4L NC. She was noted to have rhabdo as well as
acute on chronic renal failure. Aggressive fluid resuscitation
was started and her renal function has improved since and her ck
has been trending down. Her UA was noted to be equivocal for UTI
and grew VRE which per ID was likely colonization. SHe was noted
to have gram positive cocci bacteremia and was started on
vancomycin for this. speciation is currently pending. pt's
subsequently transferred to the floor for further management. on
arrival she has no specific complaint other than refusing her
vancomycin although she agrees to take her anti-seizure
medicationse.

There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
shift
of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular
territorial
infarct.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation appears preserved and there
is unchanged appearance to age appropriate atrophy.  Mild
calcifications noted within the carotid siphons bilaterally.
Soft tissues and osseous structures appear unremarkable.
Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION:

No acute intracranial pathology.
..
..
CT C-spine [**7-5**]:
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute fracture or
dislocation.  There is multilevel degenerative joint and
degenerative disc disease.  No prevertebral soft tissue swelling
is identified.  Visualized contents of the intrathecal sac
appear unremarkable.
Please note overall examination was slightly limited due to a
large amount of artifact from the shoulders.

IMPRESSION:
No acute fracture or dislocation.

..
..
[**7-5**] CXR(portable)
FINDINGS:  Other than linear atelectasis noted at the left base,
lungs appear clear.  There is mild indistinctness to the
perihilar vessels and engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature
which may suggest mild amount of fluid overload
in this patient with known renal failure.  No evidence of
pneumothorax.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are not
significantly changed. No large right effusion is identified,
however the left costophrenic angle is not included on current
film.

Surgical hardware from right total shoulder replacement is again
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Left lower lobe linear
atelectasis.

2.  Perihilar haziness and congestion of the pulmonary
vasculature likely
relates to fluid overload in this patient with known renal
failure.
..
..
[**7-5**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm 89. Borderline first degree A-V block. Compared to
tracing
of [**2163-6-14**] the premature atrial beats are absent.

..
[**7-8**] Echo:
Conclusions:
Limited images obtained. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall  motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic  function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo F with paranoid and seizure d/o, CKD, PE on
anticoagulation found down for 9 days and was noted to have
acute on chronic renal failure, apparent gram positive cocci
bacteremia. Patient admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**7-5**], transferred to the
floor on [**7-7**]. The following issues were addressed on this
admission:
.
1. Neuro/MS change: Patient was noted to be down at home.
Etiology thought to be secondary to seizure.  Patient maintained
on TID klonopin alone for seizure prophylaxis at home.  Patient
head CT negative, Utox positive for benzos and opiates.
Metabolic derangements as below. Had no evidence of trauma or
acute process by CT, cardiac enzymes cycled and remained flat.
EKG is unchanged from baseline.  Patient's mental status
improved throughout her stay and she is at her baseline on
discharge.  Neurology consulted on the patient and recommended
initiation of dilantin for seizure management.  Had no seizures
throughout stay.  Initially on klonopin 1mg TID and then
dilantin loaded on [**7-8**] evening and to start daily dilantin
dosing, 600mg qhs on [**7-9**].  On [**7-10**] patient started on Keppra as
recommended by neuro and dilantin discontinued because of
difficult dosing given patient weight and difficulty managing
coumadin dosing with dilantin interaction.  The keppra has been
titrated up and patient will be discharged on a dose of 1000mg
po twice daily.  She has had no further evidence of seizure
activity during this hospitalization.
.
2.. Renal: Creatinine of 9.4 on presentation. Acute on chronic
renal failure likely secondary to dehydration.  Evidence of ATN
here (muddy brown casts, non-oliguric).  Peak CK 1400 making
rhadbomyolysis less likely. Patient recieved aggressive fluid
resuscitation (3L in ED, 3L in ICU - with 1L D5 with 3amp HCO3)
within first 24-48 hours.  Continued to require IVF's until [**7-7**].
 Nephrology followed patient throughout hospitalization.  Renal
failure improved rapidly and by time of discharge creatinine was
1.0.  Massive post-ATN diuresis. Lytes aggressivly repleted.
NSAIDS held throughout stay. Sulfasalazine initially held and
then re-started [**7-7**].  The patient's creatinine normalized during
the hospitalization and on discharge it is 0.8.

3. Hypotension: Pt initial SBP 80s responded to fluids, never
febrile but received Abx. She has a h/o relative adrenal
insufficiency and a h/o hypotension while off steroids during
her recent admission in [**2163-6-3**]. Most likely volume related
and relative adrenal insufficiency while off steroids and no PO
intake for several days.  Resolved with aggressive hydration and
re-initiation of home dose prednisone of 5mg daily(for Crohn's).
 Empiric vancomycin was initiated from [**Date range (1) 1164**] and discontinued
beyond this time.

4. ID:  Patient has a history of VRE UTIs in the past.  On [**7-10**]
she began to have rising leukocytosis but remained afebrile.
Patient's UA was borderline for a UTI at that time with 5 wbc's.
 A repeat was performed the following day and a subsequent
culture grew out >100,000 gram negative rods, later identified
as e. coli.  The patient was initially placed on levofloxacin po
however sensitivities showed resistance to this and she was then
switched to IV ceftriaxone.  Of note, prior to the ceftriaxone
she received one dose of Unasyn.  While still on the
levofloxacin the patient developed spiking temperatures to 101
with some AMS and tachycardia.  Blood cultures were obtained
which subsequently grew out e.coli with similar sensitivities.
As above, an ID consult was obtained and they recommended a two
week course of ceftriaxone 2gm IV daily for a total of 14 days.
A PICC line was placed on the day of discharge by IR for
antibiotic therapy.
.
5. Crohn's: re-started sulfasalazine on [**7-7**].  No diarrhea or
Crohn's symptoms while here.  Also maintained on prednisone 5mg
daily.
.
6.Psych: History of Depression, Anxiety, Paranoia: On admission
patient felt to be paranoid, found in filthy apartment. Per last
admission she's refused services due to paranoia. Head CT
negative. Psych evaluated and started standing haldol with
haldol for agitation.  Continued clonopin.  By [**7-7**] with
improvement in mental status, patient's paranoia improved and
haldol discontinued.  Doxapin and restoril re-initiated as
patient at previous baseline.  Patient deemed to have capacity
to make all decisions.

7. h/o PE on anticoagulation: INR at admission 2.9, coumadin
initially held on admission.  She resumed her coumadin at an
outpatient dose of 2 mg po daily.  She will need Lovenox 40mg sc
daily until she become therapeutic as her INR today is 1.9.  Her
goal is between [**2-5**].
.
8. Hypothyroidism: TSH 0.38 (wnl here).  continued on
levothyroxine 200mcg daily here.
.
9. Asthma: maintained on home regimen of singulair.  Prednisone
as above for Crohn's.

10.Social: Patient found by EMS in "filthy" conditions (multiple
animals, urine, feces).  Department of Public Health involved
and trying to clean house along with patient's son.  [**Name (NI) **]
deemed to have capacity and will return to current living
situation after rehab after housing has been cleaned.

IMAGING:
ECHO [**2191-4-25**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
aneurysm/near akinesis of the distal 1/3rd of the ventricle.
Basal segments are relatively preserved (LVEF 30%). No masses or
thrombi are seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with moderate
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid LAD wrap-around
distribution). Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
.
CXR [**2191-4-24**]:
CHEST, AP UPRIGHT: There is severe CHF with pulmonary edema,
cardiomegaly
bilateral layering pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.

The bones are diffusely demineralized, with multiple old and
partially
displaced rib fractures resulting in marked thoracic deformity.
There is
moderate thoracolumbar dextroscoliosis, with multilevel
compression
deformities better evaluated on chest CT from [**2188-11-3**].
IMPRESSION:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Diffuse skeletal demineralization, with multiple old rib and
vertebral
fractures, better evaluated on prior chest CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with history of hypertension
and dyslipidemia who presents with acute onset of shortness of
breath and pulmonary edema with troponin
.
# CHF: Pt with known diastolic heart failure on previous ECHO
(EF 65%) presents with acute onset of shortness of breath.
Initially, she was thought to be in diastolic heart failure and
treated with diuresis and discontinuing her amlodipine 10mg,
labetolol 200mg PO Daily, holding her Imdur 60mg PO Daily in the
setting of a nitro gtt.  She was started on carvedilol 6.25mg PO
BID and her lisinopril was continued.  A repeat ECHO showed an
EF of 30%, LV apical aneurysm and moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with aneurysm/near akinesis of
the distal 1/3rd of the ventricle.  It was believed that she had
an old infarct and she now has a systolic component to her heart
failure as well.  She was properly diuresed and weaned off her
O2.  She was restarted on her home dose of lasix 20mg PO daily.
She is on aspirin 325mg PO daily and we will continue that for
prevention of thrombus in the LV aneurysm.  Given her new
finding of apical anuerysm there was long discussion about
whether to anticoagulate or not.  Given that there is no
evidence of thrombus in the aneurysm and that the event was
likely old the data does not show a strong indication for
anticoagulation.  Given her age and risk of bleeding it was
decided to continue her on aspirin 325mg PO Daily, but not to
start plavix or warfarin at this time.  This was discussed with
her grandson [**Name (NI) 1169**] and was in agreement with the plan.  She
should be monitored closely at [**Hospital **] Rehab and if she is
gaining weight her lasix should be increased.  If her BP is
elevated her lisinopril or carvedilol should be uptitrated.
.
# RHYTHM: patient was in atrial bigemeny at time of admission to
the ICU with a rate of 89.  She had not taken any of her
medications this am and so will give her her BB as prescribed.
Goal HR <80 for her in order to maximize filling time.  She
remained in atrial bigeminy throughout the course of her
hospital stay and there were no other arrhythmias noted.
.
# CAD: Pt has no history of cardiac cath on record, nor did she
report ever having a catheterization.  Has elevated troponin of
0.18, but MB was flat at 8.  In previous hospitalizations she
also had increase in troponins in the setting of CHF
exacerbation and given her symptoms and history ACS is less
likely.  Her troponin peaked at 0.33, but MB remained flat.
Repeat ECHO showed focal wall motion abnormalities and apical
ballooning of the left ventricle indicating an ischemic event at
some point between this admission and [**2189**] at the time of her
last ECHO at [**Hospital1 882**] which showed symmetric LVH and EF of 60%.
Given her new finding of apical anuerysm there was long
discussion about whether to anticoagulate or not.  Given that
there is no evidence of thrombus in the aneurysm and that the
event was likely old the data does not show a strong indication
for anticoagulation.  Given her age and risk of bleeding it was
decided to continue her on aspirin 325mg PO Daily, but not to
start plavix or warfarin at this time.  This was discussed with
her grandson [**Name (NI) 1169**] and was in agreement with the plan.
.
# HTN: Pt presented with hypertension and systolics in the 150s
in the setting of not taking her medications this morning.  She
was placed on a nitro drip in the ED to reduce afterload and
help with forward flow.  She was intially continued on her home
medications lisinopril 5mg PO Daily, labetolol 200mg PO Daily,
Imdur 60mg PO Daily, amlodipine 5mg PO Daily.  Given her heart
disease her amlodipine and labetolol were discontinued and she
was started on carvedilol 6.25mg PO Daily and continued on
lisinopril.  Her nitro drip was stopped on Day 2 of admission.
She was also eventually started on her old home dose of lasix
20mg PO daily that should be continued in the outpatient setting
given her EF of 30%.  Her BP were stable while in the hospital
and if she becomes hypertensive, her lisinpril or beta blocker
should be titrated up.
.
# Fevers: Pt had low grade temp of 99.8 in the ED and was given
vancomycin and cefepime.  She had no white count, BP are stable,
U/A negative and CXR is indeterminate given pulmonary edema.
She has been endorsing a cough for the past month that is
non-productive.  Likely not secondary to an infectious process.
She has a history of aspiration PNA and while she could have
aspirated overnight cannot distinguish between pneumonitis and
PNA at this time.  We will held off on antibiotics and she
remained afebril and hemodynamically stable.  She did not
exhibit any signs of infection and her urine culture was
negative.  Her blood cultures are still pending and need to be
followed up on.  A repeat CXR was not performed because of low
suspicion for pneumonia.
.
# Chronic Kidney Disease Stage III (GFR = 35):  Pt creatinine on
admission 1.4 in the setting of fluid overload and a baseline of
1.2.  During active diuresis her creatinine trended up to 1.7,
but on the day of discharge was back down to 1.5.  This was
likely in the setting of diuresis and her creatinine should
trend down back to baseline.   Her creatinine should be
monitored on routine screening in the future.
.
# s/p ICH on the [**2170**]'s: Pt is on Keppra and no clear reason
other than previous ICH.  No history of seizures noted.  She was
continued on her Keppra dose during her hospital stay, but she
should have neurology follow up in the outpatient setting to see
whether she requires continued administration of keppra.   Given
her age she would benefit from reducing her medication burden.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# GERD: Pt was asymptomatic throughout the course of her
hospital stay.  We Continued Omeprazole 20mg PO Daily
.
# Adjustment disorder:  Unclear if this is the underlying reason
the patient is taking venlafaxine.  We continued venlafaxine XR
37.5mg PO Daily
Keppra 250mg PO BID
.
# Asthma:  Currently stable, no wheezing and the patient did not
require any inhalers.
.
DNR/Ok to intubate for respiratory issues
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- She was continued on her Keppra dose during her hospital stay,
but she should have neurology follow up in the outpatient
setting to see whether she requires continued administration of

Discharge Instructions:
You are being discharged from [**Hospital1 1170**].  You were admitted because you were Short of Breath in
the middle of the night and required oxygen.  You chest X-ray
showed that you had extra fluid in your lungs and you were given
medication to help take some of the fluid off.  We repeated an
Ultrasound of your heart an it showed that your heart was not
pumping as well as it used to and you have some ballooning of
the heart.  We will monitor this for now, but you do not need
more therapy than aspirin daily.  We also changed around your
medications so you are on the best therapy for Heart Failure.

Date of Birth:   [**2063-1-13**]     Sex:  M

Service:  TRANS [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old man who is
status post a right upper extremity AV fistula three days
prior to admission, who now presents with right upper
extremity swelling.  This swelling is associated with
significant pain of his right arm and the patient does report
that prior to the surgery his arms were of similar caliber.

He denies fevers or chills, shortness of breath or abdominal
pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease.
3.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Pulmonary hypertension.
7.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
8.  Sleep apnea.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Right radius cephalic AV fistula in 06/[**2137**].
2.  Right lobectomy for benign lung tumor in [**2085**].
3.  Revision of the right upper extremity AV fistula three
days prior to admission.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 325.
2.  Lipitor 40 mg once a day.
3.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
4.  Nephrocaps, one tablet once a day.
5.  Lopressor.
6.  Magnesium 125 mg once a day.
7.  Imdur 60 mg once a day.
8.  CPAP.
9.  Insulin Humulin, 70/30, 33 units with breakfast and 14
units with dinner.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature of 99.7
F.; pulse 101; blood pressure 109/58; respiratory rate 22;
91% on room air.  In general, he is an uncomfortable man.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart is regular
rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft and obese.  His right upper
extremity has severe edema.  Motor is intact but limited by
the pain.  There is no palpable thrill overlying the AV
fistula.

An ultrasound in the Emergency Room showed a patent AV
fistula and no deep venous thrombosis of the right upper
extremity.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Transplant
Surgery Service.  A renal consultation was obtained for
hemodialysis and he was put on the Operating Room schedule
for the next day.  After being consented, the patient was
taken to the Operating Room on [**10-24**], where he tolerated
a ligation of the AV fistula for venous hypertension without
complication.  Please refer to the previously dictated
Operating Note by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for the specifics of this
surgery.

Postoperatively, the patient was doing well, both during his
initial postoperative check on the night of surgery as well
as the morning after surgery on a.m. rounds.  On a.m. rounds,
he was saying his pain was much decreased.  The surgical
sites were without any exudate or signs of infection and his
tenderness in his right upper extremity was markedly
decreased.

However, at approximately 09:45 on [**10-25**], which was
postoperative day one, the patient was found blue and
unresponsive by his nurse and the CPR protocol was initiated.
The patient was intubated.  He was put on a monitor where he
was noted to have pulseless electrical activity.  After being
shocked several times, he went into a ventricular
fibrillation and ultimately was stabilized with several doses
of Atropine and several doses of epinephrine and then being
put on a dopamine drip.  He was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further care following this
unfortunate event.

Cardiac enzymes were sent; however, these were negative.  A
right upper extremity ultrasound was also performed.  In the
next few days, the following tests were performed:  A right
upper extremity ultrasound which did not show any evidence of
a deep venous thrombosis; a CT scan of the chest did not show
any evidence of a pulmonary embolism, and a chest x-ray,
although showing left heart failure and pulmonary edema, did
not show any evidence of aspiration.

At this point, on [**10-26**], the situation was re-evaluated
and the patient was still nonresponsive despite having
minimal sedative doses on board.

A Neurology consultation was obtained and because of the
patient's unresponsiveness, a brain death protocol was
established.  An MRI of the head was obtained which, although
did not show any acute infarction, showed evidence of chronic
microvascular ischemia within the cerebellum and basal
ganglion.

On physical examination over the next few days, the patient
still was not responsive.  There was no improvement in his
neurologic examination.  A family meeting was done on [**10-28**] where the patient's grim prognosis was discussed with his
wife and children and the family decided that according to
Mr. [**Known lastname 1175**] wishes, that he would not want to be
maintained in a comatose state, and thus, the patient was
made "DO NOT RESUSCITATE"  and ultimately Intensive Care Unit
level care was going to be discontinued.

On [**10-31**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated and he passed
away.  His family at this point refused an autopsy.

DISPOSITION:   Death.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
male with a history of encephalitis, oral cancer, presenting
to Intensive Care Unit with shortness of breath and hypoxia
secondary to a large pleural effusion.  While in the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient had transient hypotension
and had a large O2 requirement secondary to the large effusion
and multiple pulmonary nodules almost certainly representing
metastatic disease.  The patient was stabilized with IVF and
supplemental O2.  The medical situation including presumed
widely metastatic cancer with likely malignant effusion was
discussed with the patient.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] firmly delined further
diagnostic interventions or therapies to work up and treat this.
Based on his firmly expressed opinion, his code status
was made DNR/DNI and primary driver changed to maintaining
comfort.

On [**2154-12-15**], the patient was stable for transfer to floor for
further care.  He remained with a high supplemental FiO2
requirement in order to maintain borderline sats.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**]
frequently removed his face mask saying that he just wanted to
be comfortable.  He expressed understanding that going without
supplemental Oxygen would put him at risk for respiratory or
cardiac arrest.

On [**2154-12-15**] at 11:05 pm, the senior resident was called to
see patient for unresponsiveness.  The patient had continued
to refuse oxygen during the day into the evening.  He had only
intermittently complied with wearing the mask secondary to
comfort concerns. as he had done in the MICU, and earlin the
On evaluation by the sernior resident, the patient had no
respirations.  The patient had no response to voice or
sternal rub or other painful stimuli.  The patient had no
heart sounds.  Pupils were fixed and dilated.  The patient was
pronounced dead.  The Attending was notified and family

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] is a 78 year old woman with a PMHx of afib (not on
coumadin), DM2, and dementia admitted for HHS with glucose to
1053.

# HHS: Glucose elevated to 1053 on admission with anion gap 25,
hemoconcentrated to Hct 54.  Glucose on u/a but no ketones.
Although this picture could also be consistent with
b-hydroxybutyrate ketoacidosis, the high glucose and type II
diabetes history makes HHS more likely. AG could also be
secondary lactate elevation from poor perfusion in the setting
of volume depletion. AG resolved within 12 hours of IVF. The
underlying trigger of her HHS is uncertain. Urinalysis
demonstrates 9 WBC and few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal
cells). Streaky RLL ifiltrate on CXR was thought unlikely to be
pneumonia. Ischemic cardiac event was ruled out with troponins x
4. Considering that she was reported as poorly complaint at her
ECF with medications, and refused several medications each day
while in the MICU, she likely had an aspect of medical
noncompliance either contributing or even causing her HHS. Her
non-compliance and/or inadequacy of home diabetes therapy is
further bolstered by her A1C of 12. She was started on insulin
drip, received 7 L of IV fluids, and then was transitioned to a
SQ insulin regimen [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations which included a
QACHS insulin sliding scale with humolog and QHS lantus. We held
her oral diabetes medication while inpatient. On transfer to the
floor from the MICU the patient was stable and her blood sugar
was being controlled with SQ insulin regimen.
.
# UTI: Admission urinalysis concerning for possible UTI, but
culture more likely contamination.  Pt asyptomatic.  Received
3-day course of levofloxacin.  Urinalysis demonstrated 9 WBC and
few bacteria (along with 3 epidermal cells). Urine culture with
10-100K gram positive cocci concerning for lactobacillus vs.
group a strep. [**12-24**] sets of blood cultures were positive for coag
negative staph which was thought to be a contaminant. Ms.
[**Known lastname 1187**] was treated for her UTI with 3 days of levofloxacin.
.
# HLD: Simvastatin was continued while Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was in house.
.
# HTN: Atenolol was continued while Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was in house.
Lisinopril and furosemide were held as patient initially
demonstrated pre-renal azotemia with initial creatinine to 1.3
which responded to 0.9 with IVF.
.
# afib: Ms. [**Known lastname 1187**] was rate controlled while in house with
atenolol. Aspirin was started.
.
Transitional issues:
1. Diabetes. Reportedly poor medication compliance at ECF
(patient sometimes hides pills). [**Last Name (un) **] consulted and started on
insulin per med list. Please have sugars followed closely. Thus
her Metformin and glypizide were stopped.

2. Her lisinopril and furosemide were stopped in the setting of
her acute illness. Please start these as you see fit if her
blood pressures become elevated as her systolic blood pressure
have been in the 110's prior to discharge here and thus we
didn't start them.

3. A second round of blood cultures are pending on discharge
given coag pos staph in blood culture on admission.

[**10-10**] CXR: There is no focal consolidation, and the lateral
costophrenic foci are sharply delineated. Pulmonary vascular
markings are normal. The heart size is at the upper limits of
normal, and the mediastinum is otherwise unremarkable.

[**10-10**] EKG: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Prolonged QTc
interval. Prominent precordial  QRS voltage - consider left
ventricular hypertrophy. Prominent lateral T waves of uncertain
significance - could be within normal limits or early
repolarization pattern. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since
the

infiltrate with eosinophils consistent with dermal
hypersensitivity reaction.  Note:  No intraepidermal neutrophils
are seen on multiple levels. The results of a PAS stain will be
reported in an addendum.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) EtOH withdrawal:  EtOH neg on tox screen. Pt states he has
baseline tremor ("shaky jakey" he calls himself), but it's not
clear whether the hx of tremor might be due to episodes of Etoh
withdrawl.  Valium given per CIWA scale.  His beta blocker and
clonidine were continued.  Thiamine, folate, B12, and MVI were
supplemented.  Urine and blood cultures were negative.  He
exhibited sx of insomnia, tremulousness, anxiety,
gastrointestinal upset, headache, diaphoresis, disorientation,
tachycardia, hypertension, and agitation during this
hospitalization.  He was still mildly disoriented when he signed
out AMA on the last day of hospitalization.

2) Drug rash - Treated in the ER with SQ epinephrine, steroids,
atarax, and zantac.  Biopsy was consisted with drug rash, likely
secondary to ciprofloxacin.  He should be recorded as having an
allergy to ciprofloxacin. His rash resolved.

3) FEN - He had low Ca, Mg, P04 on admission, which were
repleted.

4) Gap acidosis: He had a gap acidosis on admission that
resolved - likely alcoholic ketoacidosis +/- starvation.

5) Hematuria - The patient's foley was removed on [**10-15**], and he
subsequently complained of hematuria.  A UA was ordered, however
the patient signed out AMA shortly thereafter, before the UA
could be obtained.

The patient was transfered to the floors on [**10-15**], and
subsequently signed out against medical advice.

Service:  [**Company 191**] MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 42 year old Caucasian
male with a history of [**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome, refractory
epilepsy, mental retardation and frequent urinary tract
infections who now presents with a two day history of
increased seizure activity, increased lethargy and decreased
p.o. intake.  This history is obtained from the patient's
caregiver.  [**Name (NI) **] himself is nonverbal.  Apparently patient
has an average of six seizures per month, tonic clonic in
nature and associated with a 30 minute post ictal state.  In
the past two days he has had a total of six seizures already.
He is refusing all p.o. intake including his medications for
the past two days.  The caregiver reports that his seizures
usually increase in frequency when there is an associated
infection.  He did have one episode of nausea with
questionable coffee ground emesis one day prior to admission.
He was sent home from [**Hospital3 1196**] emergency
department after negative lavage and hematocrit of 40 one day
prior to admission.  There is no evidence of sick contacts,
fever at home, chills, cough, shortness of breath, chest
pain, pain anywhere, foul smelling urine, urinary frequency,
head injury, rhinorrhea, photophobia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  [**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome diagnosed at
age 10 associated with approximately six seizures a month.
Refractory epilepsy.  Partial synostosis of the left lambdoid
suture with compression of the left occipital lobe and
posterior parietal lobe.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Mental retardation.  Recurrent urinary tract infections.
Sinusitis.  Microcephaly.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Colace 100 b.i.d., Protonix 40
q.d., Trileptal 600 t.i.d., Zoloft 100 q.d., Tums 1500 q.d.,
multivitamin, Felbatol 800 b.i.d., Miacalcin nasal spray.

ALLERGIES:  Depakote (rash), Neurontin (rash), phenobarbital,
Zarontin.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.  The caregiver does state that
patient's mother lives in the [**Name (NI) 86**] area.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in a group home since [**2137**]
with five other mentally disabled people.  He requires
constant supervision.  He is nonverbal at baseline, but is
able to communicate his needs per caregiver.  There is no
history of tobacco, alcohol or recreational drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.3, blood pressure
130/42, pulse 100, respirations 20, sating 86% in room air.
In general, this was a pale, cachectic, Caucasian male who
appeared younger than his stated age.  He was awake, did not
make any eye contact and was extremely agitated and restless,
requiring soft restraints.  Pupils were equally round and
reactive to light.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was clear,
but with poor dentition.  Mucous membranes were moist.  Neck
was supple without lymphadenopathy, JVD or carotid bruits.
Lungs revealed coarse breath sounds anteriorly bilaterally.
Cardiac exam revealed that he was slightly tachycardiac, S1,
S2, normal without appreciable murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, nontender with normal bowel
sounds and no masses.  Extremities displayed multiple areas
of ecchymosis on his left lower extremity, but were otherwise
unremarkable without evidence of edema, erythema or unusual
rashes.  Neurologically patient moved all four extremities
spontaneously.  He was nonverbal and did not follow commands.
There were no deep tendon reflexes elicited.  Toes were
upgoing bilaterally, but there were no signs of clonus.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission notable for white count
of 18.7 with diff of 90 neutrophils, 1 band, 3 lymphocytes, 6
monos.  Hematocrit was 39, MCV 91.  Sodium was 130, BUN 19,
creatinine 0.7.  UA demonstrated specific gravity of 1.020
with pH of 8 and all else negative.  Chest x-ray on admission
was within normal limits and negative for any signs of
pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's leukocytosis and low
grade temperature, both blood and urine cultures were drawn.
These continued to remain negative throughout his hospital
stay.  Repeat chest x-ray was performed on hospital day one
and demonstrated left lower lobe atelectasis versus
infiltrate.  Patient was thus started on empiric IV Levaquin
on hospital day one.  He was aggressively hydrated with IV
fluids, initially with normal saline secondary to sodium of
130.  When his sodium normalized, he was switched to
maintenance IV fluids.  He was placed on both aspiration and
fall precautions and supervised by a one-to-one sitter at all
times.  Given his questionable history of upper GI bleed one
day prior to admission, hematocrit was followed closely and
remained stable throughout his hospital stay.  He was
continued on daily Protonix and his stools were guaiac'd, all
of which remained negative.

Regarding his seizure disorder, patient was continued on his
outpatient antiepileptics including Trileptal and Felbatol.
Since our pharmacy did not carry Felbatol, he was allowed to
take his medications from home.  He was placed in soft
restraints for his own safety during his seizure episodes.
His outpatient neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**], was informed
of the patient's in-house status.  He was also given 0.5 mg
of p.r. or IV Ativan for prolonged seizures.  As his
infection and dehydration were both treated, patient's
seizures decreased in frequency and he soon returned to his
baseline status.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia, aspiration versus community acquired.
2.  Dehydration.
3.  Refractory epilepsy secondary to [**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome.
4.  Hypokalemia.
5.  Hypomagnesemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Colace 100 b.i.d.
2.  Protonix 40 q.d.
3.  Trileptal 600 t.i.d.
4.  Zoloft 100 q.d.
5.  Multivitamin.
6.  Felbatol 800 b.i.d.
7.  Miacalcin nasal spray.
8.  Levaquin 500 q.d. for a total of a seven day course.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged back to his
group home from where he came in good condition.  He is to
continue all his preadmission medications including a seven
day course of p.o. Levaquin for his presumed pneumonia.  He
is to follow up with his outpatient neurologist within the
next two weeks.

Stat addendum:

Unfortunately, the patient was not discharged on [**9-16**]
as expected.  On the morning of [**9-17**], he went into
status epilepticus secondary to missing his scheduled doses
of his oral anti-epileptics.  He was immediately intubated
for adequate airway protection and transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for a brief stay.  In the Intensive Care
Unit, he was started on an Ativan drip to break his seizures
and was loaded with Dilantin.  His antibiotics were also
changed to intravenous clindamycin and ceftriaxone for a
presumed aspiration pneumonia.  A head CT was obtained which
was negative for any hemorrhage or acute changes from his
prior study.

The patient was extubated without any complications after a
24 hour stay in the Intensive Care Unit.  The EEG was
obtained prior to extubation which confirmed severe
encephalopathy, but no further seizure activity.  The patient
was then transferred to the floor on [**9-18**] in stable
condition.  His Ativan drip, his OT tube and his central line
were all discontinued.  His IV Dilantin was then changed to
po Dilantin and was increased by the neurology service.
Daily Dilantin levels were checked.  He continued to remain
afebrile with all vitals stable throughout the rest of his
hospital stay.  He remained seizure free and was able to
tolerate po's (both medications and food) without any
trouble.  His intravenous antibiotics were changed to a po
regimen on the day of discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He will be discharged back to his group
home on [**9-18**] in good condition.  He is to resume all
pre admission medications with the addition of po Dilantin
125 mg in the morning, 100 at noon and 100 at night.  He is
also to complete a seven day course of po Levaquin.  He is to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**], his neurologist, within the
next two weeks.

History of Present Illness:
This 48-year-old [**First Name3 (LF) 1229**] has mental retardation and a seizure
syndrome. He presents to our emergency room acutely with reports
of [**1-15**] days of abdominal
pain as described by his caretakers, who find him grimacing in
an umbilical position. He had a change in bowel habits and
decreased PO intake for 2 weeks. He is largely unresponsive and
he responds only to keep the stimulation for pain. He has had
fevers for the last few days, up as high as 104 degrees. A
workup was performed for this, and initial imaging of the
abdomen showed multiple views consistent with a free air in the
abdomen. This with a lactic acidosis, distended abdomen and a
neutrophilia band shift, along with the after mentioned history
was very concerning for an acute process which
required an emergent operation. This was especially so given the
fact that we could not adequately communicate with this
[**Name2 (NI) 1229**] and did not know the full extent of his recognition of
pain due to his mental retardation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2164-5-4**] 7:25 PM
PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST, ONE VIEW: Heart size is normal. There is
a mild hilar prominence, with patchy areas of airspace opacities
bilaterally. Given the history of prolonged seizure, these may
represent areas of aspiration. There is no pneumothorax. There
is no pleural effusion.
There is a massive amount of free intraperitoneal air, with free
air seen underneath both hemidiaphragms. Osseous structures are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Massive amount of pneumoperitoneum.
2. Multifocal patchy areas of airspace opacity, likely
represents aspiration, and possible superimposed neurogenic
pulmonary edema.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2164-5-5**] 4:07 PM
Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day
earlier in the morning.
Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged. Diffuse airspace
opacities, worse on the right side, are unchanged. There are no
new lung abnormalities. As mentioned before, these are
suspicious for aspiration. There are no increasing pleural
effusions.

ECHO
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditis or
clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease. Normal
global and regional biventricular systolic function.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2164-5-13**] 2:09 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities consistent with
bilateral pneumonia with a more focal consolidation in the
superior right lower lobe and posterior right upper lobe. Small
bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Large hiatal hernia.
3. Marked fecal impaction of the colon to the level of the
rectosigmoid.
4. Post-surgical changes in the anterior abdomen. Moderate
amount of free fluid in the pelvis, likely post-surgical.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 48 year old male with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] who presented
with abdominal pain, fever.

Initial CXR revealed free air in the abdomen. This with a lactic
acidosis, distended abdomen and a neutrophilia band shift. This
was very concerning for an acute process which required an
emergent operation.

He went to the OR on [**2164-5-5**] for:
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Exploration of retroperitoneum.
3. Open cholecystectomy.
4. Venting decompressed colotomy.
5. J-tube placement.

His pain was controlled with IV Morphine.
He was NPO with IVF. We awaited return of bowel function.
Trophic tube feedings were started. Due to possible silent
aspirations, a NGT was placed. The NGT put out a 2L of drainage.
The tubefeedings were temporarily held. The NGT was self D/C'd
on [**2164-5-9**].
His tubefeedings were restarted and he was tolerating these.
A swallow evaluation was done and he was started on pureed
solids and thin liquids.
He should continue with tubefeedings, these are now cycled. Tube
feeds can be weaned as he tolerates better PO's.

Blood loss anemia: His HCT on [**2164-5-10**] was 20.9. He received 2
unit of blood and a repeat HCT was 27.

Micro: He had MRSA blood culture from [**5-7**]. He was treated with
Vancomycin for a MRSA PNA. Vanco needs to continue thru [**2164-5-23**].

His incision was C/D/I and staples removed prior to discharge.

Respiratory: He was on nasal cannula. O2 sats dipped to the
80's% with agitation. CXR revealed possible aspiration PNA and
RLL infiltrate.

Seizure: Neurology was consulted given his seizure disorder. He
was extubated on [**5-5**] and was noted to have one brief seizure
since extubation, becoming unresponsive, jerking tonic clonic
movement of his UE was noted.
At baseline, he has approximately [**1-16**] seizures per month,
lasting 1-3 minutes in duration, with a long post-ictal period.
At baseline, he is alert and oriented to self.
He was restarted on his home meds and ordered for standing
Ativan. His goal corrected Dilantin level was >15 given
stressors of acute illness, fever. We will taper Ativan slowly
and depending on clinical course and frequency of sz.
After initially keeping his Dilantin level >15, we then aimed
for Dilantin level [**9-26**]. He required occasional Dilantin
boluses and his level should be checked at rehab.

small amt of serum acetone and +ketones in her urine which are
all consistent with DKA. Following ICU admission with an insulin
drip pt was transitioned to Insulin SQ regimen of Glargine 8u

History of Present Illness:
41 y.o. Male with current EtoH abuse, h.o. DTs, seizures

.
Pt states he usually drinks at least a 12 pack a day,
unfortunately he could not afford any more alcohol so he started
to withdraw. His last drink was yesterday at 5pm. He noted some
sweats, diarrhea chills and a headache along with tremors which
he usually experiences when he withdraws. He also noted some
epigastric pain with radiation to the back after he stopped
drinking, he started to eat something this morning and threw it
up. He threw it up because of his abdominal pain and nausea. He
said the 3 rd time he threw up he noted some blood which
increased in concentration the more he threw up. He decided to
come into the ED for his withdrawal and pain issues.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be T98.8, HR 116, BP 199/108,
RR 18, Sat 100% on RA. Her initial labwork was notable for a
negative serum tox screen including EtoH. He was noted to have
tongue fasiculations, tremors and was given initially Diazepam
10mg IV x 1, 10mg PO x 1. He was also noted to have nausea,
vomiting, epigastric pain. He was started on D5W gtt. Chem panel
showed an AG of 19 but HCO3 of only 23. Lactate 0.7. She was
given Thiamine 100mg PO x 1, Folic Acid 1mg PO x 1, Zofran for
nausea. Per ED signout pt had ketones in urine though it is
unclear as to where the urine findings were noted. He received
1L NS and was started on D5NS maintenance fluid and received
approx 100cc. Pt was also guaiac negative in the ED.
.
On the floor pt stated he still had some abdominal pain and
still felt as if he was withdrawing. He does not have any emesis
currently, his last episode was several hours ago in the ED. He
is usually seen at [**Hospital 882**] hospital and was recently there 2
months ago and hospitalized for a month for ?bad withdrawal. He
is contemplating detox at this time. The only time recently he
has been off EtoH is when he is hospitalized or in Jail. He has
a history of withdrawal seizures and DTs in the past.

Brief Hospital Course:
41y.o.Male with current EtoH abuse, h.o. DTs, seizures presents
EtoH withdrawal symptoms.

#. EtoH Withdrawal: Pt has a reported history of seizures from
withdrawals and DTs. In the ED he required Valium 20mg IV.  He
is currently not interested in terminating his EtoH abuse in
MICU.  The patient was on a CIWA scale requiring q1h assessment
with IV Valium in the MICU, and was called out when he was
tolerating a q4h po Valium scale. Pt was spaced to Q8H CIWA/
Valium 5-10mg PRN withdrawal sxs on day 6 after improvement of
symptoms. He had no Valium requirement for the last 24 hrs, CIWA
0, prior to discharge.
---- His last drink Wed at 5pm, so Wednesday (day of discharge)
is day 7.
---- SW and addiction consult in MICU and on the floor; pt
currently not interested in stopping substance use

#.  Abdominal pain:  Pt has epigastric and umbilical pain which
he states occured after he noted withdrawal symptoms.  Lactate
was normal, KUB was unremarkable, and CT abdomen/pelvis showed
no source of abdominal pain.  The abdominal pain significantly
improved on PPI, and is likely [**12-16**] alcoholic gastritis.  He does
reportedly have a history of pancreatitis with normal lipase,
and his epigastric pain radiated to back initially but the
patient's pain improved with a PPI as mentioned above.  He was
transitioned to a po PPI [**Hospital1 **] and started on Sucralfate and
viscous Lidocaine with improvement of symptoms and was
tolerating a regular full diet without difficulty. His abdominal
pain resolved on this regimen.  H pylori was negative.  He was
discharged on a 14-day course of omeprazole for gastritis.
.
#. Hematemesis: Pt reports episode of hematemesis which
clinically appears to be MW-tear given the bleeding occurred
with continued vomiting. He was given zofran for nausea.  He did
not have any episodes of hematemesis in-house, and he denied any
history of variceal blding or cirrhosis history. His hct
remained similar to prior baseline data and he was
hemodynamically stable.  He was started on a PPI as above for 14
days.  He will discuss potential GI follow up with his PCP.
.
#.  EKG changes: Patient had tachycardia, likely in the setting
of nauesa and abdominal pain, and had an EKG which showed
inferior TWI with increase in rate that resolved with lower HR.
This non-specific finding may indicate possible coronary
insufficiency, and he may benefit from an outpatient elective
cardiac stress test. The patient denied any chest pain, cardiac
enzymes were negative.
.
#. Depression: Pt has a history of depression and reports taking
Zoloft at home. He was continued on his reported home Sertraline
50mg PO daily.
.
# R Ankle pain: He has chronic R ankle pain and spasms s/p pin
in ankle and trauma from prison. We continued him on his home
tramadol 50mg TID PRN pain.

Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES:

CXR ([**2164-9-6**]):  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. The
thoracic aorta is
ectatic. There is minimal fibronodular opacity at the left apex.
A linear density along the right pleural margin is seen,
possibly consistent with a peripheral bulla. No focal pulmonary
parenchymal consolidation or pleural effusions. There is slight
fullness of the right hilum. The pulmonary vasculature appears
unremarkable. The surrounding osseous structures demonstrate
mild right convex thoracic scoliosis.

LE U/S ([**2164-9-6**]): IMPRESSION - No evidence of DVT in the left
lower extremity.

CTA CHEST ([**2164-9-6**]): IMPRESSION - Large bilateral pulmonary
emboli.

LE U/S ([**2164-9-8**]): IMPRESSION - No DVT of the right upper
extremity.

ECHO ([**2164-9-7**]): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but not stenotic. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared to the
prior report of [**2163-3-28**] (tape unavailable for review), there
left ventricular systolic function is now low normal. The right
ventricular systolic function appears preserved. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with bilateral
pulmonary emboli - she was soon transferred to the GeriMed
service.

1. Pulmonary Emboli: Presenting with hypoxia and shortness of
breath, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary
emboli diagnosed by CT. She never had hemodynamic compromise or
had evidence of right-heart strain as evidenced by ECHO.
However, she did have an initial 'troponin leak' which was a
marker of elevated right ventricular pressures. This soon
resolved. She was initiated on enoxaparin and warfarin therapy
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and then transferred to the GeriMed service. Her
hypoxia remitted soon after [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] call out and the patient
remained comfortable for the remainder of her course. A source
of her emboli or hypercoaguable status was not found (on
physical exam, by history or on lower extremity
ultrasonography). The etiology was considered likely related to
stasis as the patient was obese and used a cane to ambulate.
However, an occult neoplasm was considered possible despite a
lack of signs or symptoms. Also, other aquired and inheritable
causes for hypercoagulability were considered: Given her weakly
thrombophilic history, various laboratory studies were
recommended to be tested in the outpatient setting to determine
the appropriate duration of anticoagulation therapy, including
FVL, Prothrombin, APL and Homocysteine.

bibasilar patchy atelectasis.

[**2128-1-11**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system. The
LMCA
showed a 40% tapering distal stenosis, which did not
angiographically
appear to be flow-limiting. The LAD showed a 60% proximal and
90%
midsegment stenosis. The LCX showed a 90% proximal stenosis
followed by
a 100% distal segment stenosis. The RCA showed mild diffuse
calcified
disease in the proximal and mid segments with a 100% stenosis in
the
posterolateral branch just distal to the right posterior
descending
artery, with left to right collaterals filling the distal right
posterolateral branch artery. The right acute marginal artery
showed a
100% stenosis.
2. Left ventriculography did not adequately visualize the
ventricular
lumen due to insufficient contrast volume. The LVEF was
approximately
50% with posterobasal akinesis and [**2-9**]+ mitral regurgitation.
3. Limited left-sided hemodynamics demonstrated severely
elevated left
ventricular end-diastolic pressures of 25 mmHg, suggestive of
severe
diastolic dysfunction.

[**2128-1-15**] EKG
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. There are Q waves in the
inferior leads
consistent with prior infarction. Low voltage. Compared to the
previous tracing voltage has decreased.

[**2128-1-12**] ECHO
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferolateral and basal lateral
with apical hypokinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation present.
6.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2128-1-11**] for further
management of his chest pain and EKG changes. Heparin and
aspirin were continued without chest pain. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel
disease, [**2-9**]+ mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of
50%. Integrilin was started. Given the severity of his disease,
the cardiac surgery service was consulted for surgical
revascularization. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. As he elevated blood sugars, the [**Last Name (un) 387**]
diabetes service was consulted for assistance with his
management. An echocardiogram was performed which revealed an
ejection fraction of 40%, no mitral regurgitation, normal aortic
valve and diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis. Integrilin was
discontinued in preparation for cardiac surgery. On [**2128-1-15**], Mr.
[**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Postoperatively
he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin and beta
blockade were resumed. He developed atrial fibrillation which
converted to normal sinus rhythm with beta blockade and
amiodarone. Later on postoperative day two, he was transferred
to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His drains and pacing wires
were removed without issue. Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 1269**] continued to make
steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative six. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.

Pertinent Results:
MR C/T/L spine [**2113-4-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Edema within the spinal cord at C5-C7, likely due to
contusion secondary to spinal stenosis and trauma with blood
products within the cord consistent with hemorrhagic contusion.
2. Posterior disc bulge and osteophyte complex at multiple
levels, most
severe at C5-C6 with moderate neural foraminal narrowing
bilaterally at C5-C6 as well as moderate posterior disc bulge
and osteophyte formation at C4-C5 and C6-C7 level with mild
neural foraminal stenosis bilaterally at these levels.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar spine, most
prominent at C4-C5 with disc bulge and facet degenerative
changes causing minimal narrowing of the spinal cord and
indentation of the thecal sac.
4. Posterior soft tissue swelling with no obvious disruption of
the
ligamentum flavum, anterior, posterior spinous ligaments within
the cervical region.Increased signal in interspinous region
without widening of interspinous distance indicates trauma
without disruption.

ECHO [**2113-4-29**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no left ventricular outflow
obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

Head CT [**2113-4-29**]:
No evidence of SAH.

EEG [**2113-4-30**]:
Normal

Carotid Ultrasound [**2113-5-2**]:
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On
the right there is moderate heterogeneous plaque in the
bulb/ICA. On the left
there is moderate heterogeneous plaque seen in the bulb/ICA.

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 76/21, 56/10, 79/17 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 52 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 100 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA
ratio is 1.5. These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 75/20, 85/18, 72/16 cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic velocity
is 54 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 67 cm/sec. The
ICA/CCA ratio is
1.6. These findings are consistent with <40% stenosis.

Right antegrade vertebral artery flow.
Left antegrade vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 72 yo woman who returns from [**Hospital 38**]
rehabilitation center following a change in exam from her
discharge earlier today.  To review, Ms. [**Known lastname 931**] was admitted
on [**4-28**] after sustaining an unwitnessed fall at home.  Upon
admission, the patient was found to have a frontal and
temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage and a non displaced occipital
fracture.  The patient is experiencing significant weakness in
her hands and legs upon exam.  MRI demonstrated edema within the
spinal cord at C5-C7, felt to be secondary to a hemorrhagic
contusion.  The patient's exam was reportedly slightly decreased
from admission, but overall stable.  She was discharged to rehab
this AM ([**5-3**]).  Upon arrival to rehabilitation this afternoon,
there was concern that the patient was no longer able to move
her
legs.  In addition, he was reporting pain in her arms (right
worse than left).  Given this, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] (her prior
attending) was contact[**Name (NI) **] and the patient was referred back to
the
emergency room for further evaluation.

The patient currently endorces [**3-11**] pain in her right arm
(between her shoulder and her elbow).  She reports being numb in
her legs and states she has been unable to move her legs since
this morning.  She endorces a feeling of vibration moving across
her mid section which is uncomfortable but not painful  She has
not had a bowel movement in the last 24-48 hours.  She has a
foley that was in place since her transfer so she is unsure of
her urinary control.  She denies any headache, changes in
vision,
chills or nausea.  She denies difficulty breathing; she has no
chest pain.  All other ROS where negative.

Pertinent Results:
[**2113-5-3**] C-Spine CT: IMPRESSION: 1. No fracture. 2. Multilevel
degenerative changes, worse at C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7, with
posterior disc osteophyte complex at this level.

[**2113-5-3**] C-Spine MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Progression of the cord signal abnormality suggestive of
progressive
edema, now extending caudally to the T2 level. While this can
relate to
trauma, consider follow up and clinical/lab correlation to
exclude
non-traumatic causes.
2. Findings suggestive of a nondisplaced fracture involving the
T2 vertebral body. Further evaluation with CT/PXR can be
considered for better assessment of fractures.
3. Extensive abnormal STIR signal in the posterior soft tissues,
the
interspinous ligament, prevertebral fluid, and high signal along
the
ligamentum nuchae are all suggestive of traumatic injury
with/without
associated ligamentous injury. Small amount of facet joint fluid
at the C3-4 level and the T2-3 level. Correlate with CT.
4. High grade canal stenosis at the levels above.

[**2113-5-10**] Cspine MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in residual cord signal abnormality when
compared
with the prior study of [**2113-5-3**]. Subtle enhancement in the cord
can be seen
after contusion.
2. Marked interval improvement in edema and fluid within the
prevertebral
soft tissues, interspinous ligaments, and ligamentum nuchae when
compared with the prior study.
3. Please see report of MRI performed [**2113-5-3**] for evaluation of
stable severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine.

[**2113-5-13**] CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large bilateral pulmonary emboli with extension into multiple
subsegmental branches as described above.
2. Aberrant right subclavian artery causing mass effect on the
esophagus.

[**2113-5-13**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
Ill-defined focus of hyperintensity within the left frontal
lobe, not
identified on the prior study and could represent a small amount
of acute
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hyperdense focus within the posterior
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle also not identified on the prior study,
could represent a tiny amount of intraventricular blood. Given
the patient's history of recent heparinization, an MRI or serial
CT scans may be obtained for further characterization.

[**2113-5-14**] Bilateral Upper/Lower extremity veins ultrasound:
No DVTs.

[**2113-5-14**] MRI Cspine:
IMPRESSION:
Stable appearance of Cspine.

[**2113-5-14**] Head:
1. No change.
2. Hyperdense foci in the left frontal lobe and left occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
lateral ventricles are unchanged in size and density.




Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was seen in the emergency room and evaluated by the
neurosurgery team. She was admitted to Neurosurgery in the SICU
for q1 hour neuro checks. Her goal MAP >85 to ensure cord
perfusion (using a neosenephrine gtt as needed). She was given
Decadron 10mg IV x 1. Family was updated of current situation
and plan.
A C-spine CT and MRI were obtained. CT revealed no changes from
previous scan. MRI revealed progression of the cord signal
abnormality suggestive of contusion/edema
previously noted, now extending caudally to the T2 level and a
nondisplaced fracture involving the T2 vertebral body.

On [**5-4**] upon examination the patient had stable strengths of her
UE's, no movement of her left LE and reflexive vs extension of
her R LE to stimulation. No clonus was appreciated and patellar
reflexes were 3+ b/l. Sensation was intact to light touch. At
this time her neuro check were changed to q2hrs, but she
remained in the ICU for close neuro exams and BP control.
On [**5-5**] her neurological exam remained stable. Her SBP was
liberalized to >120 and her Neo-Synephrine gtt was weaned. She
continued on midodrine and her decadron was changed to a taper
over 5 days.
On [**5-8**] she continued to be in the ICU her neurologic exam was
improving with her right leg now with strength of at least 4 in
all muscle groups except her IP which was 2+. On [**5-9**] she was
placed on neosynephrine and she had bradycardia to the 20's. Her
LLE was moving less and her SBP goal was raised to >120. On [**5-10**]
she was continued on neosynephrine for BP control in order to
keep her SBP>120 but was unable to so her SBP goal was made
>100. Also on [**5-10**] she had an MRI of the cervical spine which
showed interval improvement.

On [**5-11**] her WBC count was 12 UA and Ucx were sent which were
both negative. Also on the 10th her SBP goal was changed to >90.
On [**5-12**] given her cnetral cord symptoms she was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1274**] for eval fo autonomic dysreflexia.  He recommended added
florinef and fluid challenging. he also recommended eval by
electrophysiology for pacer.  She was also seen by Pt and OT.
On [**5-13**] she developed shortness of breath, tachypnea,
tachycardia, and hypoxia and was found to have bilateral PE's. A
heparin gtt was initiated and a CT head and neck were obtained
after the heparin was initiated. The CT head showed a question
of a small area of SAH and the CT Neck was negative.

On [**5-14**] she was stable in the ICU and was being evaluated for
potential IVC filter placement. Also on [**5-14**] she had a CT head
which was unchanged and a MRI of the cervical spine which showed
mild increase in the pattern of spinal
cord edema, extending from C5 through C7 levels, unchanged
spinal cord
expansion at C6.
No IVC filter was placed in the setting that anticoagulation was
not contraindicated. She was given Coumadin and on [**5-18**] her INR
was 3.4 and her Heparin gtt was discontinued. On [**5-19**] the
neosynephrine drip was discontinued.
Her blood pressure remained stable on Midodrine and floricef. On
[**5-22**] she was transferred to the Step Down Unit. Her INR on
discharge was 3.8 we would recommend holding a dose for [**5-25**].

She was discharged to [**Hospital 38**] Rehab on [**5-25**] see physical exam
section for discharge exam.

Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old gentleman
with a longstanding history of coronary artery disease.  He
had an initial percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
of his left circumflex in [**2137**].  In [**2139**], he had a
catheterization that showed 100 percent right coronary artery
occlusion and a subtotal circumflex lesion with a
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty done.  At the
same time, he had a mild left anterior descending occlusion
with some venous obstruction.

Over the past few months, he has had increasing angina with
exertion.  On [**2152-1-11**], he had an exercise tolerance
test that was positive with ST depressions with
inferoposterior ischemia.  His angina is primarily between
his scapula and back.  He was referred for cardiac
catheterization which was done on [**2152-1-28**].  This
revealed an ejection fraction of 60 percent.  He had a mildly
dilated aortic root, right-dominant system, left main with a
20 percent occlusion, diagonal with 70 percent, ramus with 80
percent, circumflex with 95 percent, left anterior descending
with 70 percent, with distal left anterior descending 90
percent occlusion, obtuse marginal with 80 occlusion, right
coronary artery with 100 percent, and posterior descending
artery with 70 percent.  No mitral regurgitation or aortic
stenosis.  At that time, he was referred for bypass surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Glaucoma.
2. Tuberculosis.
3. Ventral hernia.
4. Question of lumbar stenosis.
5. Coronary artery disease (with percutaneous transluminal
   coronary angioplasty in [**2137**] and [**2139**]).
6. Left-sided headaches (with question of temporal
   arteritis).
7. Left carotid disease.
8. Diverticulitis.
9. Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  SULFA (causes hot flashes).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's height
was 5 feet 9 inches tall, his weight was approximately 175
pounds, blood pressure in the left arm was 180/66, and his
right arm blood pressure was 188/80.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Left upper quadrant diverticula and ventral
hernia.  Extremities were warm and well perfused.  There were
no varicosities.  Good circulation, sensation, mobility.
Pulse examination revealed right and left femoral were 2
plus, right and left dorsalis pedis pulses were 2 plus, right
and left posterior tibialis were 2 plus, and right and left
radial pulses were 2 plus.  Neurologically, the pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Cranial nerves II through XII were grossly intact.  A
nonfocal examination.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact.
The sclerae were anicteric and not injected.  There were
buccal mucosa.  Neck examination revealed there was no
jugular venous distention.  There were no bruits.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON THE DAY OF DISCHARGE:  White
blood cell count was 10.2, his hematocrit was 32.9, and his
platelets were 349.  Potassium was 4.7, his blood urea
nitrogen was 16, and his creatinine was 0.8.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Last chest x-ray revealed a
small bilateral effusion.  No congestive heart failure.  No
pneumothorax.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
on [**3-23**] and underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times
three.  He was extubated that afternoon.  He was initially A-
paced at 80 with an underlying sinus bradycardia at a rate of
50.

On postoperative day three, he went into atrial flutter.
After 5 mg of intravenous Lopressor, he had a nine second
pause with conversion to a sinus rhythm.  That day, he had
three subsequent pauses of about six seconds each, and the
Electrophysiology Service was consulted.  On [**3-26**], he had
some atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with a rate in
the 80s to 90s.

On the evening of [**3-27**], he went into an accelerated
idioventricular rhythm and was subsequently A-paced at 80.
He continued in a normal sinus rhythm with some episodes of
accelerated idioventricular rhythm, but he was asymptomatic.
On [**3-27**], the patient was started on 12.5 mg of by mouth
Lopressor (per Electrophysiology).  They did not recommend a
pacemaker or defibrillator placement.

The patient was transferred to the inpatient floor on [**3-29**].
His chest tubes had been removed on [**3-26**], and his cardiac
pacing wires were removed on [**3-29**].  He had been followed
throughout his hospital course by the Physical Therapy
Service.  His chest tubes had come out on the [**3-26**].  The
patient was cleared for home by the Physical Therapy Service
on [**3-30**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Vital signs revealed his pulse was
65 (in a sinus rhythm), his blood pressure was 138/64, his
respiratory rate was 18, and his oxygen saturation was  95
percent on room air.  His temperature maximum was 99.3
degrees Fahrenheit.  His weight on discharge was 79
kilograms.  Preoperatively 79 kilograms as well.  The patient
was alert, awake, and oriented times three.  The sternal
incision was clean, dry, and intact with a stable sternum.
Bilateral lower extremity vein harvest sites were clean, dry,
and intact with moderate ecchymosis on the right thigh.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a rate and rhythm.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs sounds were clear.
There were scattered rhonchi on the right side.
Gastrointestinal examination revealed there were positive
bowel sounds.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Extremity examination revealed some trace
lower extremity edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Cardiac:  Pt with 3VD, cath'd at [**Hospital3 1280**] that showed 80%
prox LAD, 80% D2, 80% prox LCx involving ostium, and patent RCA
with stent. Mid PDA with 50% stenosis.  Pt also with critical AS
with valve area 0.7cm squared with mean gradient 60mmHg.  The
pt's pre-op course was complicated by MRSA UTI which was treated
with vanc without problem.  The pt was found to have decreased
BP's in the LUE and hx LUE claudication subsequently found to
have L SCV stenosis by arteriography which was not intervened
on.  The pt went to the OR for CABG and AVR/MVR [**2115-11-6**], when
his L common carotid artery was punctured during IJ venous
access attempt.  The bleeding was controlled with pressure and
the pt was intubated for airway control. During this process,
the pt was administered fluid resuscitation and went into acute
pulmonary edema.  The CCU team was called took over the pt's
care.  He was diuresed aggressively with IV lasix drip and
nitroglycerin drip for unloading.  Pt extubated [**2115-11-7**] with [**Last Name **]
problem.  CT surgery feels the patient should wait at least 8
weeks from time of discharge to CABG because of increased bleed
risk from CCA puncture.

2.  Rhythm:  The pt was noted to be in Mobitz I HB with
borderline prolonged PR and atrial ectopy.  He was evaluated by
the EP service who felt this problem should be addressed as an
outpt.  He will have f/u for potential pacemaker device after
CABG.

3.  UTI:  The pt had a MRSA UTI while in house.  He was
successfully treated with 7 day course of vancomycin.  F/U UA's
have been negative for persistence of infection.

4.  CCA puncture:  Occurred during IJ attempt in OR.  Likely
occurred secondarily to large thyroid mass interfering with
great vessel anatomy (see below).  Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] found a
fistula between the L CCA and IJV.  Vascular surgery followed
the patient and did not feel the fistula would require
intervention.  Serial dopplers reveal a decrease in the size of
the fistula, encouraging for eventual spontaneous closure.
Mr.[**Known lastname **] did require one unit of PRBC for anemia thought to be
secondary to this bleeding.

5.  Thyroid Mass:  Found on chest CT.  Thyroid ultrasound
revealed a 4X5cm posterior heterogenous thyroid mass that was
not biopsied based on pt's coughing during procedure.  TSH 0.55
with free T41.9.  Likely represents a multinodular non-toxic
goiter.  Pt should be seen by an endocrinologist prior to CABG.


6.  Elevated R Hemidiaphragm:  Found on routine CXR.
Ultrasonographic sniff test revealed diminished (but present)
right diaphragmatic excursion.  CT chest showed RLL collapse
with mucus plug in RLL bronchus.  Aggressive chest PT initiated.
 Insentive spirometry was already being used since admission.
Pt does follow a pulmonologist at [**Location (un) 47**] [**Hospital1 1281**] for this
problem, which has been present for years.

7.  Gout:  Pt noted to have erythematous, swollen, warm R-sided
hand and foot oligo-arthritis consistent with gouty flare.
Rheumatology consulted, suggested 3 week prednisone taper.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease, aortic
stenosis severe, mitral regurgitation moderate, peripheral
vascular disease, hypertension.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Coronary artery disease, aortic
stenosis severe, mitral regurgitation moderate, peripheral
vascular disease, hypertension.

OPERATION: Case planned for an aortic valve replacement,
mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft,
cancelled secondary to intraoperative carotid injury during
left internal jugular vein Swan introducer placement by
anesthesia.

PROCEDURE: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was to undergo a possible multivalve
coronary artery bypass graft today. After anesthesia, the
patient was having an left internal jugular vein Swan Ganz
introducer catheter placed using the Seldinger technique by
anesthesia. After confirmation of placing the wire into the
superior vena cava they were unable to pass the dilator.
Upon withdrawal of the dilator, brisk red blood was coming
out the small skin incision that appeared to be pulsatile.
Immediately direct pressure was applied and an intraoperative
vascular surgery consult was obtained. It took approximately
25 to 30 minutes for pressure to achieve excellent
hemostasis.

Intraoperative Duplex ultrasound of the carotid showed
antegrade flow with a very small low flow left carotid to
left internal jugular vein fistula. It was felt by the
vascular surgeon that this would probably thrombose on its
own and would be re-evaluated within the next day.

Given the nature of the injury and the patient being a
vasculopath, we elected to obtain a neurology consult as well
as attempt to wake the patient up. After reversal of the
chemical paralysis and sedation, the patient did in fact move
all of his extremity to command and perform complex tasks.
The patient was therefore extubated and appeared to be
neurologically intact.

At[**Last Name (STitle) 1289**]time the case was cancelled and the patient will be
brought back to the intensive care unit for critical
monitoring of all organ systems. Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was present
and participated throughout all significant portions of his
preoperative care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted on [**12-23**] he had been scheduled earlier however with
central line placement there was the creation of an av fistula
by anesthesis causing case to be delayed. General [**Doctor First Name **] eval was
obtained for toxic goiter and combination of thyroid and
CABG,/[**Doctor First Name 1291**] was planned, endocrine evaluation was obtained and
recommendations were followed regarding calcium monitoring and
supplementation.

there was some concern over CVA, because of left hand weakness,
Imaging and neurologic consultation revealed this to be a
re-manifestation of an old stroke that resoved with time, , Pt
was extubated [**12-26**] and started on Keppra for neurologic
protection, MRI of brain was performed, in CU had ARF with
elevation of creatinine, pt was subsequently reintubated Drips
and natrecor were D/C'ed 112/29 pt was extubated and
intermittently folowing commands, [**12-31**] thoracentisis was
performed for effusion,, [**1-2**] wide complex tachycaria ensued,,
Vent dependent Respiratory failure occurred, was intermittendly

DIAGNOSIS:  Sepsis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (Summary of the patient's medicine
Intensive Care Unit course from [**2130-12-15**] until
[**2130-12-18**])

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old
male with recently diagnosed nonHodgkin's lymphoma in
[**2130-9-11**].  The patient presented with low back pain
and was found to have a poor compression.  The patient was
treated with radiation and steroids from [**Month (only) **] until
[**2130-10-18**] and then discharged to [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation for rehabilitation.  The patient was
readmitted on [**2130-11-8**] for Rituxan treatment per
oncology, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  After receiving first dose of
Rituxan the patient had an adverse reaction including
hypotension, tachycardia, fever and hypoglycemia.  The
hospital course was notable for syndrome of inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone, change in mental status and anemia.
The patient was then discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2130-11-12**].  The patient now returns to the Emergency Room on the
day of admission with lethargy and shortness of breath.  The
patient has been undergoing treatment with Levofloxacin for
presumed pneumonia since [**12-11**].  At [**Hospital1 **] the patient
was short of breath and was given in addition to Levofloxacin
Vancomycin for treatment of presumed pneumonia and referred
to the Emergency Room.  In the Emergency Room the patient had
a temperature of 100.8 and was hypotensive with a systolic
blood pressure of 77.  In addition, the patient was in mild
respiratory distress and was hypoxic with an oxygen
saturation of 88% on 4 liters.  The patient was diagnosed
with presumed sepsis from pneumonia and started on
intravenous fluid resuscitation, and sent to the Intensive
Care Unit.

ALLERGIES:  Rituxan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is single, has no children.  The
next closest [**Doctor First Name **] is his brother.  Lives alone prior to recent
illnesses.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  Alert and
oriented to person, hospital and year but drowsy.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat, oropharynx with dry mucous
membranes, no jugulovenous distension.  Cardiovascular,
regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  Lungs with crackles
at bases bilaterally.  Abdomen, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive hepatomegaly.  Spleen not palpated.
Extremities, no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Skin, warm.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant laboratory data on admission
revealed white count 16.9, hematocrit 27.1, platelets 329,
creatinine normal at 0.7.

Microbiology - Blood cultures from [**2130-12-15**] with no
growth.  Urine, Legionella antigen negative.

Chest x-ray from [**2130-12-15**], development of diffuse
bilateral interspace disease.

Echocardiogram, [**2130-12-18**], ejection fraction of 45%,
left atrium normal in size.  Left ventricular wall thickness
and cavity size were normal.  Mild globar left ventricular
hypokinesis, right ventricular systolic function was normal.
No valvular disease.  No pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While the patient was in the Medicine
Intensive Care Unit from [**12-15**] to [**12-18**]:

1.  Sepsis - The patient presented with fever of 100.8,
hypotension and tachycardia consistent with sepsis.
Differential diagnosis included pneumonia with admission
chest x-ray showing bilateral diffuse patchy infiltrate.  In
addition, the patient with PICC line and concern for line
sepsis.  The patient was started on broad spectrum
antibiotics with Vancomycin, Levaquin, Ceptaz and Flagyl.
The patient was volume resuscitated with 10 liters of normal
saline.  The patient was started on stress dose steroids with
Hydrocortisone 100 mg q. 8.  The patient required pressors
with Levophed to maintain blood pressure for approximately 24
hours and was then weaned off.  The patient's respiratory
status remained stable on 4 liters of nasal cannula.  For
evaluation of pneumonia, the patient was unable to produce
sputum sample on admission.  Blood cultures drawn showed no
growth.  In addition the PICC line was removed and tip
culture was sent which showed no growth.  Likely the patient
has atypical pneumonia given chest x-ray findings.  On
hospital day #3 Ceftazidime and Flagyl were discontinued as
unlikely that the patient had aspiration or pseudomonas
pneumonia.

2.  Hematology/oncology - Patient with a history of
nonHodgkin's lymphoma, follicular type.  He received one dose
of Rituxan in [**2130-10-11**] and had an adverse reaction.  In
reviewing medical records, the patient with abdominal
computerized tomography scan in [**Month (only) 359**] which showed
retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  In addition
there was lymphadenopathy at the gastroesophageal junction
and anterior pancreas.  There was also noted to be an L3
vertebral body lytic lesion.  Further chemotherapy treatment
was postponed given current active infection issue.

3.  Cardiovascular - The patient with no known history of
coronary artery disease.  Echocardiogram done on hospital day
#3 showed moderately reduced left ventricular ejection
fraction of 45% with no focal wall motion abnormalities or
valvular disease.  After receiving multiple intravenous fluid
boluses for volume resuscitation for treatment of sepsis, the
patient was subsequently diuresed when hemodynamically
stable.

4.  Psychiatry - The patient with a history of paranoid
depression.  On the hospital day #3, the patient was
restarted on outpatient medications, Celexa and Remeron.

Further hospital course while on medical floor to be
dictated.

ADDENDUM TO [**2130-12-18**] DISCHARGE SUMMARY - SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL
COURSE FOLLOWING MICU CALL OUT:  In summary, this is a
73-year-old male, with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
cord compression, depression, BPH, who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for sepsis and respiratory failure, treated in the ICU,
and called out to the floor with resolving respiratory
failure, sepsis, with a presumed pneumonia.  Please see above
dictation for ICU course.

1) SEPSIS:  The patient was called out from the MICU with
resolving sepsis.  He remained hemodynamically stable on the
floor.  The patient finished his 7-day course of
hydrocortisone, was continued on Levofloxacin IV with
transition to PO, and continued on vancomycin.  Sepsis was
presumed to be due to underlying pneumonia, as evidenced by
chest x-ray, though no organisms was ultimately identified in
either the blood, sputum, or urine.  Prior PICC line site
catheter tip was also negative.

2) PNEUMONIA:  The patient was treated for bilateral
interstitial fluffy infiltrates on chest x-ray.  Differential
diagnosis including atypicals and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient improved
clinically on broad-spectrum antibiotics initially, and
subsequently continued on Levaquin and vancomycin.  There was
some initial suggestion that the chest x-ray looked
consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] the patient had been on long-term
steroids for cord compression.  However, the patient
clinically improved without bactrim, or treatment for his
Pneumocystis carinii, for suspected PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  The
patient will be discharged on a 7-day course of Levofloxacin
500 mg po qd, and vancomycin 1 gm IV q 12 h x 7 days.  The
patient will be discharged on prophylactic dose of bactrim,
as the patient will continue decadron 4 mg po qd for cord
compression and for continued treatment of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.  On discharge, the patient was breathing
comfortably on room air with resolved respiratory failure.

3) TYPE 2 DIABETES, INSULIN DEPENDENT:  The patient's blood
sugars were relatively uncontrolled during his hospital stay,
as the patient was given IV steroids as part of the sepsis
protocol.  The patient's Lantus dose was increased to 20 U q
hs with an aggressive Humalog sliding scale, and on the day
of discharge blood sugars remained in the 150s-250 range.
The patient will need careful follow-up as high-dose steroids
will be discontinued on the day of discharge, with assessment
of blood sugar and need to titrate down on the Lantus and
Humalog as needed.

4) NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA:  The patient will be continued to
be followed at [**Hospital1 **] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for continued
management of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  The patient will
be discharged on decadron 4 mg po qd.

5) ANEMIA:  The patient was transfused 2 units for acute
blood loss in the ICU.  The patient's hematocrit remained
greater than 30.  On discharge, the patient will continue his
Epogen 4,000 units twice a week for persistent and chronic
anemia.

6) DEPRESSION:  The patient's affect was relatively flat with
some evidence of paranoia.  He will continue on his
citalopram 20 mg po qd with follow-up with his primary care
physician for further management.

7) DECONDITIONING:  The patient has a long history of
rehabilitation, inactivity and loss of function secondary to
cord compression.  Cord compression has improved per
information from his prior extended care facility.  He will
need aggressive physical therapy and occupational therapy at
his new extended care facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  The patient is breathing
comfortably on room air, attempting ambulation with
assistance, and tolerating PO.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is expected to be discharged
to the [**Hospital1 **] acute care facility for rehabilitation, with
transfer to lower level care as needed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure.
3. Pneumonia, bacterial, unspecified.
4. Type 2 diabetes, uncontrolled.
5. Anemia, acute blood loss.
6. Lymphoma.
7. Failure to thrive and deconditioning.

Lungs showed a few bibasilar crackles.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Exam
showed S1 and S2 with a regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Exam showed healed midline
surgical scars and scars related to his kidney transplants
and ileostomy.  He had normoactive bowel sounds.  Abdomen was
soft and nontender.  Kidney grafts were palpable per the
emergency department.  RECTAL:  Rectal examination was
heme-positive.  EXTREMITIES:  Extremities were without
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Examination
showed a right foot tremor.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed a white count of
7.4, which was 80% neutrophils, and 13% lymphocytes,
hematocrit 23.4, platelets 384, MCV 83, sodium 141, potassium
4.4, chloride 107, bicarbonate 23, BUN 23, creatinine 1,
glucose 117, INR 1.2, PTT 24.2, calcium 5.9, magnesium 1.5.
Urinalysis showed 21 to 50 white cells with many bacteria,
less than 1 epithelial, positive nitrates, less than 1 RBC.
The EKG showed a QTc of 416 with left axis deviation and left
anterior fascicular block.  T-wave flattening was noted in 3
and AVF.

ASSESSMENT:  This was a 55-year-old male with end-stage renal
disease status post renal transplant on chronic
immunosuppression, who had a seven-point hematocrit drop in
one week after recent ileostomy reversal on [**2166-10-21**], now
presenting with heme-positive stool.  The patient was
evaluated by surgery in the emergency department.  It was
felt that there was [**Last Name **] problem with the anastomosis and that
his abdominal examination was entirely benign.  The most
recent cadaveric graft is functioning well.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Hospital course by system:

HEMATOLOGY AND GASTROINTESTINAL:   The patient was transfused
an additional three units of packed red blood cells during
his stay.  The hematocrit bumped appropriately.  He was given
iron replacement.  Hemolysis slides were sent and were
negative.  The Department of Surgery felt that there was [**Last Name **]
problem with his anastomosis and that the abdominal
examination was benign; recommended on intervention.
Gastrointestinal consultation was obtained and they
recommended deferring colonoscopy, as the patient has been
through multiple recent colonoscopies without any lesions
noted, and that there was no evidence of an acute bleed.  EPO
level was sent and needs to be followed up at rehabilitation.
The aspirin was discontinued.  The urinary tract infection
was treated initially with Ciprofloxacin.  This was changed
to Bactrim, as Ciprofloxacin interferes with cyclosporin
levels.  The patient's urinary tract infection was attributed
to an E. coli bacteria recovered on urine culture.  The
sensitivities of this E. coli need to be evaluated by the
rehabilitation staff in a few days to make sure he is
receiving adequate coverage.  The the hypocalcemia, he
received 2-g of calcium gluconate in the emergency department.
  He was restarted on his calcium trial, and it is
felt that his hypocalcemia may be related to not being able
to received calcium trial as an outpatient.  He was also
given Os-Cal with vitamin D 500 mg two tablets b.i.d.
Calcium gluconate was given a second time for 2-g on the
afternoon of the 31st and the Os-Cal with vitamin D was
changed to Tums, three tablets p.o. t.i.d.  The calcium trial
dose was changed to .25 mcg p.o.q.d. starting on the morning
of the lst.  Calcium gluconate was repeated a third time on
the morning of the lst as well.  The magnesium was also
treated with IV replacement.  Note is made of the fact that
cyclosporin can cause renal magnesium wasting, therefore, the
patient was given IV magnesium and is to start a regimen of
p.o. magnesium supplementation at rehabilitation.  Neuropathy
was treated with Percocet, Nortriptyline, and Neurontin, per
his home regimen.  He was also given OxyContin q.h.s. on the
31st.

Cardiovascular disease was treated with his home Atenolol and
Lipitor.  The aspirin was held in the setting of GI bleed.
Of note, the patient apparently got two times his usual
morning dose of Neoral and a resultant Neoral level on [**11-12**]
was elevated.  Therefore, his [**11-13**] morning dose was held.
However, once it was realized that this was due to a double
dosing the day before, the Neoral dose was given.

Plan is for rehabilitation to give him his p.o. dose this
evening and for a level to be checked before he is given his
a.m. dose in the morning with the belief that the level will
be acceptable once he is on a regular schedule.  The renal
consultation team followed the patient in house and confirmed
his immunosuppressive regimen.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies during his stay showed
the white count to remain stable in the 7.4 to 9.1 range.
The hematocrit bumped appropriately after transfusions from
23.4 to 35.1.  Coagulations were stable with an INR of 1.2
and PTT of 24.2.  The patient's BUN remained in the range of
18 with a creatinine of 1.  The bicarbonate was well
controlled at 24, potassium was well controlled at 4.4.
Labs, including LDH were normal at 233 with the T bilirubin
of .3.  Calcium after repletion was 7.7 in the context of an
albumin of 3.1.  Ionized calcium was obtained.  The free
calcium improved from .87 to 1.07, which is in the
near-normal range.  The cyclosporin level, initially high at
1,072, returned to 132 holding a single dose.  The PTH was
sent, but pending.  The haptoglobin was elevated at 434 and
TIBC was decreased at 248, not indicating a chronic
iron-deficiency state.  Ferritin was 61 and normal.
Transferrin was 191.  EPO level at the time of discharge and
E. coli sensitivities are still pending.

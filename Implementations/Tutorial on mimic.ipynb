Since the _Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health_ <b>(HITECH)</b> Act was signed into law in 2009, adoption rates of these systems have steadily increased<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>1</b></a></sup>. Adler-Milstein et al.<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>2</b></a></sup>, who analyzed survey data collected by American Hospital Association found that EHR adoption rates were at <code><b>80%</b></code> in __2017__, twice the rate in __2008__. With higher adoption rates comes the rising challenge of _data processing and analysis of unstructured clinical text._ Due to the unstructured nature of clinical notes, providers often employ trained staff and/or third-party vendors to help assign diagnostic codes using coding systems such as the International Classification of Diseases __(ICD)__<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>3</b></a></sup>.\n","\n","__However, manual assignment of ICD codes is problematic:__\n","1. It is both time consuming and error-prone, with only <code><b>60-80%</b></code> of the assigned codes reflecting actual patient diagnoses<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>4</b></a></sup>\n","1. A significant portion of code assignment results in misjudged severity of conditions and code omissions<sup><a href=\"#references\"><b>5</b></a></sup>\n","1.

To create a labeling function, KeyClass simply assigns a keyword to its closest category as measured by the cosine similarity between their embeddings.
